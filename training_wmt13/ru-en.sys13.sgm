<seg id="1"> The Republican strategy of resistance re-election of Obama </seg>
<seg id="2"> Republican leaders have justified their policies need to combat fraud in the election. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, the Brennan Center said last myth, arguing that the cases of election fraud in the United States are more rare than death from a lightning strike. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In addition, lawyers Republicans counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for ten years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is for sure : these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense, these actions partly discredited system of American democracy. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike Canada U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> That is why most state governments since 2009 have introduced laws that complicate the process of registration or voting. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has received new impetus after the elections in November 2010, which brought the Republicans 675 new jobs in 26 states. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, only one was made in 2011 180 laws that restrict the right to vote in 41 states. </seg>
<seg id="11"> New election laws require voters to present photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, abolish the right of a voter registration on the day of expression and the right to take away votes from citizens who have a criminal record. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the elections in 2006, no U.S. state is not obliged to present voters identity card with a photograph. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Indiana became the first state, who made a similar demand. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of the 2008 law passed in Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The republican authorities were quick to extend this and other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In the last two years they have initiated bills requiring voters to present photo ID, in 34 states. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have such a universal identity as a health insurance card. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11% of American citizens, we have 21 million people who have reached the required voting age do not have a photo ID issued by a governmental authority of the state. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, five million new voters in 2012 did not have such a document. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In this case, the cost of obtaining the required identification is often greater than one hundred dollars. </seg>
<seg id="22"> New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, 25% African American, 15% of people earning less than 35,000 dollars, 18% of people over 65 years old and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years old do not have the required photo ID. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But that&apos;s not all. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Students - voters who are thought to vote for Democratic candidates in several states are not allowed to use photo identification issued by their institution. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But these same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs who vote mostly for Republicans to use the voting certificate issued by these clubs. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Prior to 2004, no state required proof of U.S. citizenship to vote. </seg>
<seg id="28"> For the first time such a requirement was introduced in Arizona. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Since 2011 more than a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures clearly are meant to limit the vote of Hispanics. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It is estimated that two -thirds of Latino voters voted in favor of the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated in 2011 legislation abolishing the registration of voters on election day in eight states. </seg>
<seg id="33"> They also limited the right of individuals or groups to assist those who wish to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> This restriction was not without consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, during the 2004 election campaign for the registration of voters helped make a list of about 10 million people. </seg>
<seg id="36"> At the same time, the measures adopted since 2009 have led to a drop of 17% in the registration of new voters in 2010 compared with 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In addition, Republican lawmakers passed in five other states, laws aimed at reducing the early voting period. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida 33% of voters who voted early were African Americans, although the latter accounted for only 13% of the total electorate of the state. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The same thing happened with immigrants from Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Representing only 11% of voters, they constituted 24% of people who voted early. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Unlike whites, who form 76% of voters who voted early were among only 46%. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters to actively oppose the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Several draft laws were vetoed by governors -Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The action of the most controversial laws were suspended through the intervention of the Prosecutor General of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="45"> It is allowed to partially limit the negative effects. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 of the 34 states have enacted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID. </seg>
<seg id="47"> However, the new rules came into effect, of course, make it difficult to exercise the right to vote in the 2012 election. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Critics decry the Democratic bias laws that have been adopted, seeing in them an obvious focus on ensuring that affect the results of the 2012 elections in key states. </seg>
<seg id="49"> The report from the Brennan Center in 2011 shows that the states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the Electoral College to win the presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the presidential elections in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Only one thing is certain: these new regulations will have a negative impact on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, these actions partly discredited system of American democracy. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Screening for prostate cancer: take the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> In fact, PSA test sometimes gives erroneous results lzhenegativnye and sometimes lzhepozitivnye which lead to medical intervention useless. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Men, and so reluctantly undergoing medical examinations, have something to begin to doubt even more. </seg>
<seg id="56"> To take the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We asked the opinion of two experts. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In studies conducted in the United States, there were numerous cases of infection among the groups studied, so these data are difficult to interpret and difficult to work out any clear recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, this time to a European, found different levels of mortality in those patients who were screened and those who did not pass. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The study also found after a 12- year follow-up, that the probability of metastasis is 30-40% higher than in those who did not pass the screening. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Therefore, I would recommend to take the test beginning at age 50, or 40 if one of the immediate family had prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> African-American men are also at increased risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key point is to take the right decision as soon as the cancer is detected. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Cancer can be both aggressive and sluggish. </seg>
<seg id="65"> The patient needs to clarify the risk of his cancer, offering him options, without having to treat prostate cancer that is not life threatening in the long term, and making the choice, in these cases, in favor of active surveillance for the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> To date, many men whose cancer is detected, will not undergo treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to life. </seg>
<seg id="67"> We will offer them active surveillance, and if the disease will progress, we begin treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Increasingly, we define with precision the criteria for deciding who should or should not undergo treatment. </seg>
<seg id="69"> So I would still recommend to take the test. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But it is also important to consult your doctor to determine whether or not to pass this test. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In collaboration with the International Association of Urology, Movember has created a tool that allows you to evaluate the pros and cons of the test for PSA. </seg>

<seg id="73"> prevent Disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress of scientific research, compliance with a healthy lifestyle is the best way to reduce the risk of disease. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is believed that if all the people fed and healthy enough to move, 30% of the cancerous could have been prevented. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If no one else is smoked, this figure would increase to at least 50%,&quot; - emphasizes Andr√© Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Association of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="78"> However, it is estimated that 10% of cancers caused by heredity. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Several types of cancer are quite inexplicable. </seg>
<seg id="80"> Canadian Association for Cancer tobacco control remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Smoking is associated with 85% of lung cancer cases. </seg>
<seg id="82"> And it is a risk factor for many others. </seg>
<seg id="83"> It causes tremendous harm to people&apos;s health. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Even today, in Quebec, there are 1.5 million smokers,&quot; - says a spokesperson Andre Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="85"> The encouraging fact is that 10 years after quitting the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> According to CAR, overweight and obesity also contribute to the emergence of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="88"> They increase the risk of cancers of the breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas, and cervix. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer,&quot; - added to the Association. </seg>
<seg id="90"> nutrition </seg>
<seg id="91"> The association also recommends limiting intake of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In very large quantities, it increases the risk of cancer of the colon. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Should be avoided as sausages. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Canned Meat by smoking, salting and drying can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;These may harm the cells of the body and cause cancer&quot; - explains the Association. </seg>
<seg id="96"> vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, many scholars engaged in research into the effects of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> But at the moment the results of these studies can not be considered unambiguous. </seg>
<seg id="99"> According to the SCC, studies of vitamin E give conflicting results. </seg>
<seg id="100"> If one of them showed a reduced risk of prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result. </seg>
<seg id="101"> In assessing the impact of the development of cancer Vitamin D is also not clear. </seg>
<seg id="102"> However, Mr. Beaulieu stresses that their concerns and family history is important to discuss with your doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;Letting the analysis does not lead to cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> Higgs boson in the details </seg>
<seg id="105"> Last summer, reported that scientists may have found the Higgs boson, caused quite a stir - and not without reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> It is thought that this explains the boson mass of all particles in the universe, no less. </seg>
<seg id="107"> In addition, this is the last particle whose existence was predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or, at least, the &quot;least imperfect&quot; description of the nature and behavior of matter - but which previously could not be detected experimentally. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But physicists still do not fully believe that we are talking about the Higgs boson. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know without a shadow of a doubt that we are dealing with a really new particle and that it resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model. </seg>
<seg id="110"> In addition, the new data presented this week at a major physical Congress in Kyoto, seems to confirm this, though to be sure of some data still lacking. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Imagine, however, that it is about the Higgs boson, as the chances to make a mistake seem minimal, and see what it means. </seg>
<seg id="112"> There is, in this world, one law completely unavoidable, stating that the two things can not be in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> To bypass this rule there is no way, do not try too hard, or do harm to himself. </seg>
<seg id="114"> But although the physics of elementary particles is a rather strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of this nature : the Pauli exclusion principle, which postulates that two particles can not occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same &quot;quantum state&quot; - a &quot;state&quot; is, in general, some of the characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="115"> Accordingly, physics separated particles into two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In one corner, we find the good citizens, called fermions, which wisely obey the Pauli principle. </seg>
<seg id="117"> In the other bustle bosons vile band anarchists have no respect to what - at least to this principle, which means that they can be quietly in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> As the site (by the way, quite unusual) Particle Adventure Berkeley Lab, these bosons are divided in turn into two groups: mesons, which we will not be here to speak, and &quot;particle forces,&quot; which are distributed by the main forces of nature and to which in some ways is the Higgs boson. </seg>
<seg id="119"> These same bosons, it should be emphasized, not all such exotic creatures as you might think. </seg>
<seg id="120"> In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to one incredibly banal boson : the photon, or &quot;particle of light&quot;, which is &quot;messenger&quot; of the electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> In fact, when one particle having an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it &quot;breaks&quot; the electromagnetic field in that particular place, much like a stone thrown into a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> From this &quot;infringement&quot; is born an electromagnetic wave (light or infrared radiation or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing like the photon - and therefore one of the bosons &quot;vectors of force.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="123"> More stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, with the only difference being that for this boson appeared to be &quot;violated&quot; the other field, the Higgs field. </seg>
<seg id="125"> However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field, to excite him, to achieve a very, very high energy, as if it were a frozen pond, the surface of which could only shake a very large rock. </seg>
<seg id="126"> That&apos;s why a huge particle accelerator, like the one operated at CERN - The Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a diameter of 27 km! - To achieve such enormous energies. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs boson mass. </seg>
<seg id="128"> In fact, not all the particles are not all the materials interact with the electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, such as magnets interact others - no: paper, for example, never itself will not stick on the fridge. </seg>
<seg id="130"> Similarly, not all of the particles interact with the field Higgs those that interact are mass while others (photon way) it does not have. </seg>
<seg id="131"> So what does &quot;can bring&quot; all of these studies, asked Ms. Plamondon? </seg>
<seg id="132"> In science, they are used to verify the correctness of the Standard Model (SM), and it also allows the physicists to find the discrepancy between observations and forecasts CM. </seg>
<seg id="133"> In addition, some of them crave to such a discrepancy was found, because the slightest discrepancy could open the door for &quot;new physics&quot; and plug some holes models. </seg>
<seg id="134"> The latter, it must be said, still has significant shortcomings without offering any explanation for gravity (ouch!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the universe (oy-oy!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> But while at CERN, such differences are not found. </seg>
<seg id="136"> aftermath </seg>
<seg id="137"> The benefit of this research to the daily lives of the average person is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that it is not. </seg>
<seg id="138"> See : In the early 60 -ies of the pioneers of laser research at Bell Labs could not even imagine what a revolution will cause them to work. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They foresaw their applications in science, but not much more. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact, now deceased physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where in 1960, the laser was invented, and that he developed the first continuous laser (previous were pulsed) in 1962, said that initially the laser was considered more as a &quot;gadget lab.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> And besides, the application can be found for instruments accompanying the study. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, the same Uilliard Boyle during his optical studies in 1969, has developed a small light sensor. </seg>
<seg id="144"> This sensor, although it does not have its original purpose, now serves as the &quot;eye&quot; for all digital cameras of the world and earned the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="145"> This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Large Hadron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it just goes to show, in fact, that it can be. </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care - the best way to die... | &quot;Debt&quot; </seg>
<seg id="147"> In the Commission for a dignified death in Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of end of life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> Debate to resume soon, but at this time preparing a bill. </seg>
<seg id="149"> Nevertheless, in this critical area, much remains to be done. </seg>
<seg id="150"> &quot;Duty&quot; tried to get a closer look. </seg>
<seg id="151"> Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was living alone in his apartment in Monterezhi. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Prostate cancer is destroyed from the inside, gave him a two-year reprieve. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;I was given five years, I lived seven,&quot; - he says, between life and death, lying in a bed in the shelter of palliative care Victor - Gadbois in Belay, where he arrived the day before. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;But it&apos;s always a shock, it is impossible to prepare for,&quot; - he said. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease does its job : the incredible weakness that does not go to the toilet independently and even to eat independently. </seg>
<seg id="156"> Sitting at a table on which there is a tasty lunch, he gives in and agrees to help him eat. </seg>
<seg id="157"> He is willing, even manages to smile and talk to strangers who work around him, bring him medicine, lead him into the bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> Courage in the normal death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My greatest wish is that I was cured of diarrhea, it is humiliating,&quot; - he says. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the staff found a cure for this disease. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;Over a lifetime, we are taught that a man should pee standing up&quot; - says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the shelter Victor - Gadbois. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Regress to a state of a child - for some unbearable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;Everything depends on the person&apos;s ability to&quot; come to terms with the demise - he says. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because, in the opinion of many people involved in palliative care, important events sluchayayutsya and in the midst of this decline. </seg>
<seg id="165"> Patients who enroll in hospice palliative Victor - Gadbois, all have cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> Forecasts by assigning them a maximum of three months of life. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses do not provide more aid, called &quot;treatment.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="168"> Mrs. A., 89 years old, most of all afraid of dying &quot;in the minds of suffocation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="169"> But the disease has allowed me to get to know their children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have good kids,&quot; - she added. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;That&apos;s all I want in life,&quot; - she says, before allowing her to put a mask for breathing. </seg>
<seg id="172"> She is still waiting for a few days last visit to his son, who came from Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> The shelter Victor - Gadbois by a group of volunteers provide care for the body and help with nutrition. </seg>
<seg id="174"> This is palliative care, which is when nothing more can be done. </seg>
<seg id="175"> To make death more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec, for every 11 700 inhabitants have one place in palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="177"> It is very small, given that sooner or later we will all die. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Here life goes on in the best conditions as possible, explains Dr. Christian Martel - one of the doctors shelter. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Whether it&apos;s physical comfort, emotional or spiritual. </seg>
<seg id="180"> Dying we agree to provide oral rinses of brandy or Pepsi, depending on what he asks for. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Diabetics we do not force to control blood sugar. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And death is a part of everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Last night we brought the beer to Mr. H., who died last night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> In the morning, his son drank the beer at the feet of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;We help loved ones, as well as patients,&quot; - says Nathalie Savard, Director of Nursing. </seg>
<seg id="186"> The shelter Victor - Gadbois no day is like the previous one. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Next to the 93 -year old man who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the yard, sitting on their cushions during a toast in his honor, died tragically young man 36 years old, surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children and pereprobovashy everything to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;In the last six months, three to five beds are always occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45 years&quot; - anxiously says Dr. Christian Martel. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of patients taken to the shelter Victor - Gadbois, come home, and 47% of the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> The problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> It is estimated that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, to the care that is provided to ease the suffering of patients included in the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in hospital or in a shelter. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And some institutions, such as shelter Victor - Gadbois and the Society of palliative care at home Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively to the care of cancer patients. </seg>
<seg id="193"> It&apos;s this big gap in the Quebec health care system leads many doctors - specialists in palliative care, to fear a law legalizing euthanasia and assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since October circulated a manifesto signed by luminaries in the field of palliative care, Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lyapuantom and testifying about their disagreement with such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec&apos;s health care system is not effective enough to ensure the right to quality palliative care before will be allowed to transfer to euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Recently, - she says - I saw the patient, who spent 14 days in the emergency room, in terrible pain, and no one has taken the necessary measures to alleviate them. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I &apos;m afraid that patients want to die just because they do not receive adequate care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> At the same time, many oncologists to the last day trying to save the patients, despite the pessimistic forecasts. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Hopes for the survival of Ellen Richard has been minimal, when she stopped debilitating chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> When I told my oncologist that I stop treatment, she replied to me that he was sorry that I stop the fight, - she said. </seg>
<seg id="201"> However, she told me herself that my days are numbered! </seg>
<seg id="202"> There is no all-powerful care </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr. Martel suggests that 90% of patients who ask about death, thank medical staff for what they have not fulfilled their request, after a team of palliative care eases their pain. </seg>
<seg id="204"> However, it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the fight against pain. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care in the Society of palliative care at home Greater Montreal, patients are susceptible to pain management in 8% of cases. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the very end of his life the doctors often resort to palliative sedation in which the patient is asleep until his death, or from time to time, or permanently. </seg>
<seg id="207"> One can no longer pretend that we do not know about these sufferings. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Increasingly, patients who fail to relieve pain, can have access to palliative sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients suffering from pain, always say the same phrase: &quot;I want to die.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="210"> But that does not necessarily mean &quot;I want my great euthanasia&quot;, it means &quot;I want to make me feel better.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="211"> Creating this story was made possible thanks to a grant from the Institute of journalistic Health Research Canada. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Officials responsible for the construction of roads, building contractors, builders funds of political parties and experts in the Italian Mafia, day after day tell what they know about the colossal &quot;system&quot; entangles the construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and mobsters. </seg>
<seg id="214"> &quot;Industry&quot;, which is very costly to taxpayers of Quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;I wonder how this system falls apart after having been put into the case by all means, jokes Jacques Dyusheno, MP and former chief of police of Montreal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="216"> Thanks to him, in 2011, a scandal broke out as a side result of the investigation of malfeasance related to road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the Prime Minister at the time of the Liberals, Jean Charest, has agreed very reluctantly. </seg>
<seg id="217"> &quot;Report Dyusheno&quot; established a direct link between the industry, the secret funding of political parties and corruption. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he said, only one Department of Transportation would save a billion dollars in contracts,&quot; if some restrained their instincts to take share. </seg>
<seg id="219"> Charbonneau Commission &quot;has shifted the two mayors,&quot; he added, hoping that it will &quot;open the circuit behind the individual personalities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="220"> Constant unit to combat corruption, created in 2011 </seg>
<seg id="221"> For the case was connected created in 2011 Constant unit to combat corruption, compiled of the extensive state government auditors, investigators and analysts. </seg>
<seg id="222"> And, in addition, by a special unit &quot;The Hammer&quot;, which after 2009 made &quot;cesspool cartel&quot; of Montreal, to stop overstating the value of contracts. </seg>
<seg id="223"> In recent weeks, has been made a series of raids, and some municipal officials, including Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte - the mayor of a small town, was charged with fraud and corruption. </seg>
<seg id="224"> The next step - Gilles Vayyankur, recently retired from his post as mayor of Laval, the third largest city of the province of Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="225"> He is suspected of repeatedly accepting bribes in Government orders. </seg>
<seg id="226"> In addition, formal charges were brought against a number of service engineers Railways Montreal and construction contractors Italian origin, including Tony Akkurso and Lino Zambito. </seg>
<seg id="227"> Last detonated a bomb, telling investigators about the &quot;system&quot; get government contracts. </seg>
<seg id="228"> For several years, Zambito gave 3% of the value of contracts awarded in Montreal, certain intermediary associated with the Mafia, which, in turn, transferred money Party Mayor G√©rald Tremblay &quot;United Montreal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="229"> In the 2000s, Zambito littered money right and left. He listed more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to different parties province, mainly liberals, who was then in power. </seg>
<seg id="230"> In addition, he admitted that he illegally raised funds for the former deputy prime minister from the Liberal Party of Natalie Normandy. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Sewer contracts in which overstated the value of </seg>
<seg id="232"> Monreale B &quot;systems&quot; korrupcii practiced bezotkazno. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Syurprenan Gilles, a former civil engineer, described it in detail before the committee : in the ten years he has received from construction companies gifts, invitations to travel to golf tournaments, in restaurants, at hockey matches and bribes for a total of 736 000 dollars in exchange for sewer contracts, the cost of which he overstated. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Other officials, responsible for the construction of roads, said they received the paw by overstating accounts for 30-40% with fake supplements. </seg>
<seg id="235"> Zatem Odin organized around parties m—çra, Martha Dumont accused Mr. Tremblay in a volume, chto on namerenno zakr—ãval GLAZNE of sushtestvovanie parallelynogo budget napolnyavshego partiyn—ãe kass—ã gryazn—ãmi denygami. </seg>
<seg id="236"> After these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging into a deep crisis of Montreal. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members in Montreal, who scored the alarm. </seg>
<seg id="238"> The mayor of the county Riviere de Prairie to the east of the island, it is opposed to the 2010 sale of municipal land, purchased for$ 5 million and resold for... 1.6 million developers in the midst of a construction boom. </seg>
<seg id="239"> 70% of dirty money in election campaigns </seg>
<seg id="240"> She says that in the investigation, which will eventually be launched, it &quot;will pull the thread that allows to understand the functioning of the system, infested by ants to stop the gangrene and identify those responsible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="241"> This process characterizes it as a &quot;painful but positive.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="242"> We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigation team and the observer to avoid the return of questionable practices. </seg>
<seg id="243"> How do we clean the house. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Regularly. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Jacques Dyusheno notices for his part that &quot;officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars,&quot; but it is particularly concerned about the role of &quot;elected officials who knew about the scheme,&quot; but did not participate in the fraud. </seg>
<seg id="246"> Given that the share of dirty money in the financing of the election campaign in Quebec is 70%, he joked : &quot;I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="247"> The Quebec government proposes to limit to$ 100 donations to parties, but, as he said, it will not change the situation: &quot;While we do not strictly limit the elective expenses, politics will be dirty money.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="248"> It requires a complete overhaul of the system of public contracts and the financing of political parties : &quot;We can not go below; boldly penetrating into the essence of things, we will be able to build a house on a solid foundation, with better control and legitimacy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this story and casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Dyusheno encourages those who laugh, look in your own backyard... </seg>

<seg id="251"> This season you are in Paris Saint-Germain have made an extraordinary scale. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How do you explain this growth? </seg>
<seg id="253"> This can be explained by the individual consciousness, but it can - and a new dimension to PSG. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Profits are great players. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Next to them, I am growing every day. </seg>
<seg id="256"> Technical staff also brought a lot. </seg>
<seg id="257"> These factors make me every day to raise the level of my game. </seg>
<seg id="258"> And during the game, it&apos;s easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> In football everything happens very quickly. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I do not inflame. </seg>
<seg id="261"> From the beginning, in the center of preconditioning in NIF Klerfontene and before I came to St Etienne, I always stepped forward. </seg>
<seg id="262"> This way, you get the benefit of competition, the installed Carlo Ancelotti... </seg>
<seg id="263"> Replenishment of this summer is nothing new to play games is very high. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They also know that every workout is very important. </seg>
<seg id="265"> This leads to the fact that a player like me, eager to be on the level, and to do your best. </seg>
<seg id="266"> In addition, Carlo Ancelotti has supported my positioning. </seg>
<seg id="267"> He is assisted by substituents such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Ancelotti - master of the situation? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti commands respect around the technical staff. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Today in the First Division he has no equal, and it&apos;s one of the best coaches in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He has extensive experience, and he won many titles with high-end clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He worked with great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think it will bring new titles Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January I had with him was reassuring conversation. </seg>
<seg id="276"> Then I continued with a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The confidence that he has me also explains my achievements. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What do you think about the first part of the season PSG? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In the First Division Lyon took us the leader. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we are still at the ready. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our main goals is to Champions League: we effectively qualified for the eighth finals. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the purpose of the club in this tournament? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We will try to get as far as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> From now on, anything can happen. </seg>
<seg id="285"> We will be able to have their say face to face with a very good European teams. </seg>
<seg id="286"> We first want to finish first in our group in front of the port to be able to take the second leg in the eighth finals. </seg>
<seg id="287"> Can PSG become a first class European club in the short term? </seg>
<seg id="288"> He has to have a budget that is already... </seg>
<seg id="289"> In order to become a major European club Paris to win titles and consolidate the position for the long term. </seg>
<seg id="290"> Today it is not. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Financially at PSG have the means to make this project a reality. </seg>
<seg id="292"> Do not take the title in the First Division, as last season, will be a big failure? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, it would be a big disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year we want to get really hot this title. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Last season we were close to it. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May, it was frustrating because we had it all to reach the finish line first. </seg>
<seg id="297"> It was a very successful season. </seg>
<seg id="298"> We finished it with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Typically, 79 points implies the championship. </seg>
<seg id="300"> But the other team, Montpellier, has played an even more fantastic season. </seg>
<seg id="301"> This year, I think everything will be okay. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Despite the fact that the fight for the title came such strong teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think we have the strength to win. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do not you think that the media are waiting for too much from Paris Saint-Germain? </seg>
<seg id="304"> It is normal to expect a lot from us, considering how much has been invested and what our players. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We are fully prepared for this. </seg>
<seg id="306"> On the other hand, when we are winning 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find what to criticize, of course, it&apos;s a little frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> We ask ourselves, what are primarily expected from us humans. </seg>
<seg id="308"> We will never be able to win every weekend with a score of 4-0. </seg>
<seg id="309"> –ü–µ—Ä–µ–≤–æ–¥ —ç—Ç–æ–π —è–∑—ã–∫–æ–≤–æ–π –ø–∞—Ä—ã (–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ö—Å–∫–∏–π &gt; –∞–Ω–≥–ª–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–π) –ø–æ–∫–∞ –Ω–µ –ø–æ–¥–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∏–≤–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è. </seg>
<seg id="310"> We are trying to implement a project of the game. </seg>
<seg id="311"> The team is formed with time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> We have proven in the Champions League, we can respond to the challenge. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look at Manchester United, which has two seasons, you can not go to the eighth finals, although they also spent a lot of money! </seg>
<seg id="314"> Given the amount invested, we have represented for 15 points ahead by the winter break. </seg>
<seg id="315"> This would be a disregard for our opponents and for the championship of France. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille, who were not at the height of last season, had been &quot;woken up&quot; by this new PSG. </seg>
<seg id="317"> This shows how exciting League. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say to myself that, despite all the difficulties, as a result we won. </seg>
<seg id="319"> PSG seems to be entirely dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. </seg>
<seg id="320"> So what if they say that there is a &quot;Zlatanozavisimost.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="321"> It only means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores a lot of goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> He came to this, and he proves that he is the star of League One. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Wherever he played, he showed that he is a great player and a global star. </seg>
<seg id="324"> In the group we respect him as a person and as a player. </seg>
<seg id="325"> He also respects the people who surround him. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he did was truly exceptional. </seg>
<seg id="327"> It stimulates and others improve their game. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, and motivates everyone to move forward. </seg>
<seg id="329"> How did you survive Euro 2012 against France? </seg>
<seg id="330"> How disappointing. </seg>
<seg id="331"> It is my fervent wish to participate in this Euro. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury prevented me to snatch a bit of playing time. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I saw a lot of things, and I came out stronger. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today I am able to play a good qualifying matches. </seg>
<seg id="335"> This is what I hoped for since my baptism in CT. </seg>
<seg id="336"> We have learned from what happened in the Ukraine, and is now expected to behave in an exemplary. </seg>
<seg id="337"> What do you think about the first months Didier Deschamps led the Blue? </seg>
<seg id="338"> They are for him effective. </seg>
<seg id="339"> He has a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="340"> He was a strict coach, it is close to the players and the inspiration for the victory. </seg>
<seg id="341"> What was Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I would not want to compare. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Blanc has reached his goal, he qualified us to the Euro. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps will result in the Blue Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Well deserved a draw (1-1), taken out on October 16 in Spain - is a fundamental match? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This match gave us confidence. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Everyone was fighting for everyone. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Prior to this shock in Spain, in my career there were no such matches. </seg>
<seg id="349"> Pay and sell without the help of banks - with Bitcoin </seg>
<seg id="350"> The complete opposite of the current money exchange, based on the central banks, numbered transactions between the parties receiving c fee to process them. </seg>
<seg id="351"> Furthermore, as is often the case with these technologies, it is obvious political vision : the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), while a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and protected by the type of communication protocol BitTorrent, which allows you to transfer files between members of one level. </seg>
<seg id="353"> Approximately 200,000 operations have been reported with 15,000 computers in the network. </seg>
<seg id="354"> Several thousand sites accept Bitcoin donations to carry or as a means of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> Bitcoin exchange rate, reaching a high of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later dropped to$ 2 before returning today to around ten dollars (courses listed on the site bitcoincharts.com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> Nothing special in comparison with the global exchange of real money or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on virtual currency, issued in October, became interested in this system. </seg>
<seg id="358"> He describes bitcoin as &quot;the most successful virtual currency&quot;, &quot;competing with the dollar or the euro,&quot; and &quot;like a normal currency.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="359"> Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies, such as &quot;loans&quot; are used to promote a video game that are earned in the game or who might buy (and sometimes to exchange). </seg>
<seg id="360"> Social network Facebook has also developed a similar system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> But the exchange transaction is always in control and process a central authority. </seg>
<seg id="362"> In all the Bitcoin network nodes are both holders of the ledger, auditors, issuers of exchange, buyers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How does this network? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Each transaction between two users is really going on between the two e-mail addresses, like e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Only for each new payment, you can choose a different address, thus ensuring anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> A set of information relating to this transaction shall be signed electronically, using an encryption system with double key. </seg>
<seg id="367"> The network may also verify the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Thanks to the content of the file is possible to check that the Bitcoin used in the transaction, do exist in the public account books sent out over the network. </seg>
<seg id="369"> A key step is to register a new transaction in the book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> It passes through the solution of a mathematical problem, sent out by computers, decided that, if temporary central bank, is granted the privilege to add this new line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> We are talking about the phase of the hash file, ie the transformation of a large file to a digital signature, short and unique. </seg>
<seg id="372"> Computers &quot;take&quot; a new transaction number and add it before &quot;hash&quot; all together. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The goal is to find a number that gives a unique digital signature (the number of zeros at the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="374"> Once this number is found, the other nodes are easy to check that it is correct. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The transaction is thus effectively connected with a chain nerarzryvno all other transactions, any modification will change the digital signature. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If tricking the user very quickly (in less than ten minutes), wished to pay two times one and the same theme of money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would have remained unconfirmed since they have different electronic signatures. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer decides to challenge gets 50 bitcoins. </seg>
<seg id="378"> To avoid inflation, the reward is regularly divided in half, probably before the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> Number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to one hundred million, that still leaves a reserve... </seg>
<seg id="380"> The challenge is also increased with increasing processing power. </seg>
<seg id="381"> Life network has experienced ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Sites that provide services to Bitcoin, were attacked, and bitcoins were stolen from the reserves. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;Use the defect does not apply to the protocol itself,&quot; - assured Noisy Pierre, who recently launched Paymium - the company makes payments to real money using a network of Bitcoin. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The ECB also informed about the possibility of money laundering through that this anonymous service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> But cash also have this disadvantage. </seg>
<seg id="386"> The big players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Others, such as the blog platform WordPress, they are allowed to. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Nedabiah Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron throughout Veytsmana Institute in Israel proanalizirovali schetnuyu knigu and obnaruzhili, chto almost 80% bitkoynov not b—ãvayut in turnover. </seg>
<seg id="389"> &quot;Giant sale&quot; were announced in November. </seg>
<seg id="390"> &quot;Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged,&quot; rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works in Coinabul, which is engaged in converting bitcoins into gold. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre Noisy, another author of the manual for this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operational network. </seg>
<seg id="392"> His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or contactless payment via mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to verify transactions that way is cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="393"> The owner better control their personal information and can thus be anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software. </seg>
<seg id="395"> One need only provide the address, which you can &quot;take a picture and recognize&quot; the phone, said Pierre Noisy, assuring that it has been around for thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There is a general tendency to revise the hierarchical systems in favor of a more horizontal. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;Before Bitcoin be established, it may take a while, but 2013 could be a turning point,&quot; - he predicts. </seg>
<seg id="398"> The ECB, in its report suggests, by the way, to reconsider a variety of risks that are considered higher today, in the event of the success of this system. </seg>

<seg id="404"> Our affected mostly Afghan farmers, we were treated like terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="405"> And we, with 88 soldiers killed and wounded and maimed. </seg>
<seg id="406"> Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often from farmers who reject the presence of a foreign army, as it was in the Soviet Union. </seg>
<seg id="407"> They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks. </seg>
<seg id="408"> They suffer, they sometimes help local rebels, but they will no longer be, as soon as the West will behave more sensitively. </seg>
<seg id="409"> Care of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I watched from the heights of the hills planted with almond trees due to French credit, took place in the order. </seg>
<seg id="410"> Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles, accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked. </seg>
<seg id="411"> Since the late 2014 invasion of the Taliban in Kabul will not. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Circumstances have changed since the time of their irresistible progress from 1994 to 1996. </seg>
<seg id="413"> While Kabul was empty, the country was in flames and blood because of the struggle between the different factions. </seg>
<seg id="414"> The capture them under the control of the country then was perceived as a kind of liberation, return to safety. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Afghan women have paid for obscurantism of the peasants, in which they surpassed Al- Qaeda, but the situation has not improved and in our days. </seg>
<seg id="416"> Former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the Taliban present are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The main characters of the anti-Soviet war, returned to power in 2001 </seg>
<seg id="418"> They have turned into speculators, exciting public land to resell them for building returnees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of the huge American subcontracting contracts. </seg>
<seg id="419"> They discredited, most of them, by the way, do not even fought. </seg>
<seg id="420"> People, as I heard in the countryside, they want a government that would consist not of thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many young people want to leave, leave as those who managed to American generosity : the outflow of capital is significant. </seg>

<seg id="428"> At the moment the army is. </seg>
<seg id="429"> Power that would be her command, will be considered legitimate? </seg>
<seg id="430"> Old commanders were leading the anti-Soviet struggle, are already taking steps to restore the provincial teams who would not obey the central government. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences should be decentralized to some extent, on the model of Western countries, but the United States would like to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister, which had existed since the 1964 Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="432"> President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly before elections scheduled for April 2014. </seg>
<seg id="433"> But his country since the 50&apos;s, and even earlier, dependent on foreign aid. </seg>
<seg id="434"> Industry was not put on your feet, no dam is not functioning, no irrigation system is not repaired. </seg>
<seg id="435"> Everything is imported, nothing is done, other than fruit and vegetables. </seg>
<seg id="436"> Priority is given to private initiative. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In a country ravaged by thirty years of war, government control over the infrastructure would be needed. </seg>
<seg id="438"> It was rumored that Afghanistan has vast mineral wealth. </seg>
<seg id="439"> This has reinforced the feeling that the Western countries were present there, only to take possession of them. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Without energy for the processing of iron ore and copper in place, with no means of transportation to export them through the mountains, there is no mining. </seg>
<seg id="441"> The Chinese had almost left the Mes Aynak copper deposit, leaving the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig out a huge Buddhist complex and remain the largest employers of the province. </seg>

<seg id="451"> Difficult birth of the Egyptian Constitution </seg>
<seg id="452"> This is the new risky move President Mohammed Morsi. </seg>
<seg id="453"> While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the issue of constitutional declaration that temporarily gives him extraordinary powers, he decided to play for broke. </seg>
<seg id="454"> Catching everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly will vote on the final text the following day. </seg>
<seg id="455"> A week ago, the head of the state Assembly has provided two additional months to finish the job. </seg>
<seg id="456"> It will soon be two years since Egypt is based on the preliminary text, which was amended several times, weakening the institutional stability and lead to legal controversy. </seg>
<seg id="457"> This new initiative has strengthened the division of the country. </seg>
<seg id="458"> According to his opponents, President persists in his &quot;autocratic delirium&quot;, continuing &quot;to break the word&quot; and &quot;trample on the right.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="459"> In the camp of his followers believe that it is a way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis by speeding up the transition process. </seg>
<seg id="460"> The referendum shall be held within fifteen days. </seg>
<seg id="461"> A very short period of time, which makes the Brothers to abandon the intention to explain the Egyptians text article by article. </seg>
<seg id="462"> For the President, it is also a way to restore the social and democratic legitimacy, while dissatisfaction is raging across the country. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Mohammed Morsi, seems to believe that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in an interview with U.S. weekly magazine Time. </seg>
<seg id="464"> The more so that the call for an accelerated vote is like an ultimatum to the Egyptian people : &quot;Either you vote for my text, or I leave myself emergency powers&quot; that are supposed to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="465"> In this strange atmosphere of 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted yesterday for text. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Most liberals did not respond to the call. </seg>
<seg id="467"> In mid-November, just before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to communicate their views. </seg>
<seg id="468"> Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities and civil society to do the same. </seg>

<seg id="470"> Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Not surprisingly, most of the articles were voted unanimously. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Commentators, by the way, was amused by the fact that one of the few disagreements of the day came around... time for prayer, as some members of the committee felt that the clock of the Constituent Assembly were set incorrectly. </seg>
<seg id="473"> The text on which the vote was still going yesterday, consists of 234 articles. </seg>
<seg id="474"> The object of everyone&apos;s attention, Article 2 in the end remained identical article of the 1971 Constitution, which states that &quot;the principles of Sharia are the main source of law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="475"> Salafist party, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the basic requirements, hoping to replace the &quot;principles&quot; to the &quot;rules&quot; that would enable them to more rigorous use. </seg>
<seg id="476"> For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed, is a testament to their good will and respect for other members of Egyptian society. </seg>
<seg id="477"> &quot;Hypocrisy&quot; - are responsible liberals who see this as a PR. </seg>
<seg id="478"> Because, in their view, the Islamization of the Constitution is through the other articles. </seg>
<seg id="479"> They point in particular to Article 220 , which gives Al-Azhar University advisory role, particularly in regard to the verification of conformity to Sharia law. </seg>
<seg id="480"> According to the specialist on Egypt Sophie Pommier, it is alarming, because &quot;people called to make decisions that are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="481"> We can observe the emergence of a theocracy. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="482"> Many liberals also thrilled by the fact that following the rector of the university is likely to be far less moderate than the current one. </seg>
<seg id="483"> &quot;At the moment there is no specific religious interference. </seg>
<seg id="484"> With this constitution we remain within the framework of civil law. </seg>
<seg id="485"> Most of the lawyers who worked on this text - it&apos;s not ulema, and people with a university education, some were trained in the French system &quot; - quiet Alexis Bloe that preparing a thesis on Egyptian constitutional transition. </seg>
<seg id="486"> But he admits that &quot;around Article 220 may be ambiguous, since the terms used in it are borrowed from the religious vocabulary. </seg>
<seg id="487"> This applies in particular to the &quot;fiqh&quot; [ Islamic jurisprudence - approx Ed.]. </seg>
<seg id="488"> And in the future, the question may arise as civilian judges are competent to make decisions about it. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="489"> In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday, has been criticized because it gives wide powers to the President of the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="490"> The Muslim Brotherhood claim that they are much lower as compared to what was under the old regime. </seg>
<seg id="491"> Another controversial point: the powers of the army. </seg>

<seg id="586"> &quot;The great and mighty&quot; to bring Moscow : Migrants are saving money on the tongue </seg>
<seg id="587"> While MPs and human rights activists argue that the law will give the mandatory language test, the country has emerged scammers selling &quot;fake&quot; certificates </seg>
<seg id="588"> Every year in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia come 13 million guest workers. </seg>
<seg id="589"> For the most part it is the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. </seg>
<seg id="590"> Their only goal - to earn money to support families back home. </seg>
<seg id="591"> On December 1, by force of law, according to which every migrant worker will be required to pass an examination on the Russian language. </seg>
<seg id="592"> While this is true only for those who intend to work in the service industry, housing and utilities, life and retailing. </seg>
<seg id="593"> However, with time, - promise to FMS - tests will be mandatory for all visitors. </seg>
<seg id="594"> Besides, it is necessary not only to take the language, but also the history of Russia, and the basis of legislation. </seg>
<seg id="595"> Knowledge of the language will have to confirm and to receive, and to extend the work permit. </seg>
<seg id="596"> The exception only applies to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language. </seg>
<seg id="597"> Not subject to the law and the people, who are already receive certificates and diplomas of education before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. </seg>
<seg id="598"> The good, the doom and protection of human </seg>
<seg id="599"> Network exam points will operate under the auspices of the Institute of Russian Pushkin, Peoples&apos; Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University, and other Russian universities. </seg>
<seg id="600"> Migrants are able to pass the tests in all the cities, now in Russia, opened more than 160 such centers. </seg>
<seg id="601"> The initiative was supported by the introduction of testing and the deputies of the State Duma, and FMS. </seg>
<seg id="602"> But human rights activists before the law came into force, many times in the press had time to ask the question: what is, in fact, give us? </seg>
<seg id="603"> What is necessary to change the language and knowledge for the Russians, for themselves and visitors? </seg>
<seg id="604"> First of all - meet representatives of the migration service - it will reduce the number of people suffering from a &quot;labor of slavery.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="605"> A lot of talk now about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, says the head of representation of the FMS of Russia in Tajikistan Victor Sebelev. </seg>
<seg id="606"> Protection of their rights should be started before their departure. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Only a system of organized recruitment will allow a 90% solve the problem of foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="608"> Problems arise in migrants without a profession, education, not knowing the language, not having a medical examination. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Without understanding the language - sure Sebelev - is doomed to face the future worker with unscrupulous people who, under the guise of helping him stick in &quot;ticket&quot; to a spooky close hut, where he and dozens of others like him will languish for months without food or documents, grinding away for 12-14 hours per day. </seg>
<seg id="610"> We get a lot of complaints from our workers. </seg>
<seg id="611"> &quot;At home, they promise one thing, but on arrival they are cheated, deprived of their passports, do not pay the promised wages&quot; - confirms the Head of labor migration in Tajikistan Tolib MS Sharipov. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Not ruhaysya, nasyalnyka! </seg>
<seg id="613"> However, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics, intending to work in Russia, recognized that not only do not know the language of the country you want, but on their own, then write with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="614"> Of course, this is not so much their fault, how much trouble is few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get even a sensible primary education. </seg>
<seg id="615"> After all, even their families have nothing to feed my children, not to mention the fact that they wear well, put on shoes and equip the school. </seg>
<seg id="616"> Grow into adolescence, these guys are at the first opportunity go to work. </seg>
<seg id="617"> It is difficult, if poorly with the knowledge of the language - they are recognized. </seg>
<seg id="618"> &quot;You feel humiliated and inferior.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="619"> However, with regard to the law on language rights activists point out one important point. </seg>
<seg id="620"> Testing will be conducted only for those workers who have legal status. </seg>
<seg id="621"> If the status is not - there will be no examination, no further official work. </seg>
<seg id="622"> Meanwhile, the majority of migrant workers are still living in Russia illegally. </seg>
<seg id="623"> &quot;Welcome, or No Trespassing&quot; </seg>
<seg id="624"> Many visitors claim to be made official in our country is not so simple. </seg>
<seg id="625"> The reason - a bureaucratic obstacles and all the same language difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="626"> In addition, legalization is worth the money : 12 to 16 thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="627"> But the false registration can be done quickly and in just one and a half thousand. </seg>
<seg id="628"> Employees of the Russian police know that we basically false documents, no registration, hence the cases of extortion. </seg>
<seg id="629"> &quot;Ask a hundred, two of cigarettes, tea,&quot; - shared with reporters a Tajik citizen Umed Hushkadamov. </seg>
<seg id="630"> &quot;Flown, do not be stingy, buy painting&quot; </seg>
<seg id="631"> On the first day of the entry into force of the language that the fake are not only migrant registration documents. </seg>
<seg id="632"> Several &quot;fake&quot; certificates of passing the language test is seized by the FMS. </seg>
<seg id="633"> Fake papers are printed on a standard color printer. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Of course, they got new owners not for nothing : each of migrants who hoped in this way to ease the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="635"> This is two and a half times more expensive than the official testing procedure : it will cost migrant workers in three thousand. </seg>
<seg id="636"> The fact that the main task for the near future - protect the system from corruption to &quot;crust&quot; could not just buy converge and government officials, and human rights activists. </seg>
<seg id="637"> In the meantime, the authorities can promise guest workers, have not been able to successfully pass the test the first time, the time to learn the basic language course. </seg>
<seg id="638"> In addition, visitors who do not speak Russian, will be offered in the areas of work that will not require active communication with people. </seg>
<seg id="639"> MIA does not take into circulation illegal arms market </seg>
<seg id="640"> The share of crimes involving legal weapons is extremely small </seg>
<seg id="641"> Russian Interior Ministry proposes to toughen the law against the owners of the civilian weapons. </seg>
<seg id="642"> This is the authorities&apos; reaction to the recent incidents : Press shots at weddings, when there were no casualties, and the massacre of Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which resulted Press killing seven people. </seg>
<seg id="643"> Police want to ban the wearing of travmatiki in public places and raising the age at which one can get a license for weapons - from 18 years to 21 years. </seg>
<seg id="644"> Idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and anti-corruption Irina Spring and promised that the amendments to the law on weapons will bring to the State Duma in the near future. </seg>
<seg id="645"> Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem by &quot;tightening the screws&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="646"> The network has an open letter, which the authors - representatives of various social organizations rifle - need to abandon the &quot;senseless tightening.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="647"> Percentage of bullying with a registered weapon is minimal, said the Russian service Bi -bi -si - criminalist lawyer Vasily Foresters. </seg>
<seg id="648"> According to statistics from the Ministry for the six months of 2012, 142 crimes committed with a firearm registered in the police, while the total for the same period recorded 1,168,000 crimes. </seg>
<seg id="649"> The authors of the open letter are sure that the tightening of legislation in the field of civilian weapons does not put the offender to go to the &quot;black&quot; market. </seg>
<seg id="650"> Now, they say, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price. </seg>
<seg id="651"> Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry claimed that the situation under control with the spread of illegal weapons. </seg>
<seg id="652"> Suppliers: from plants to officers </seg>

<seg id="658"> The next kind of &quot;black gun&quot; - stolen by criminals in the security forces. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Baranez explains that this includes police and carried away from the stores, and directly stolen from law enforcement officers. </seg>
<seg id="660"> Illegal &quot;trunks&quot; go on sale from military warehouses. </seg>
<seg id="661"> Many military warehouses often had a blast. </seg>
<seg id="662"> &quot;There is a proven version of that part of the arson attacks were made specifically - to conceal the shortage,&quot; - says a former military man. </seg>
<seg id="663"> The mite, according Baranets, bring arms producers. </seg>
<seg id="664"> &quot;Now multiply private armories that are no longer competitive in the international market and throw the gun under the counter on the black market, including Moscow,&quot; - said the expert. </seg>
<seg id="665"> Another source of &quot;black&quot; market - contraband. </seg>
<seg id="666"> Especially a lot of pistols and submachine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan. </seg>
<seg id="667"> &quot;There is the manufacture, sometimes craft, and formed a mob, which organized the flow,&quot; - says a former military man. </seg>
<seg id="668"> Location weapons? </seg>
<seg id="669"> The experts considered what is the approximate percentage of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons in the &quot;black&quot; market. </seg>
<seg id="670"> Report on this in 2011, prepared by the Centre for Problem Analysis and the Governance. </seg>
<seg id="671"> Experts analyzed the statements of the Interior Ministry and the Federal State Statistics Service, criminological literature and open data portals weapon subjects. </seg>
<seg id="672"> The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers wrote, comes from the army and security forces. </seg>
<seg id="673"> Half of all weapons on the black market was there &quot;because of the officials whose work is related to weapons,&quot; the report said. </seg>
<seg id="674"> According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places of armed conflict, in 14% of cases occur during the production of theft of weapons, 5% is &quot;black archeology&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="675"> Shop assistant of one of the gun shops, who asked not to say his name, says that the weapons found black diggers, has long no one is buying - too old. </seg>
<seg id="676"> More often than not, as he says, with the new party sellers are going to a military warehouse. </seg>

<seg id="684"> Price of the barrel I only found out there </seg>
<seg id="685"> military commentator Viktor Baranez </seg>
<seg id="686"> To get the barrel I need a friend who has a way out, - says the shop assistant. - I have a friend there, but I do not believe in it. </seg>
<seg id="687"> The vendors on the market there, but there also needs to come conditionally &quot;from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell my daughter that the tooth fell out.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="690"> Newcomers looking for weapons in different ways. </seg>
<seg id="691"> Former military Victor Baranez dabbled as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when preparing to publish an article about it. </seg>
<seg id="692"> Scheme, he said, have not changed. </seg>
<seg id="693"> He was given a photo album, where there was &quot;anything.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="694"> &quot;I felt like a luxury store,&quot; - says the military. </seg>
<seg id="695"> To the buyer, according to Baranets not offer a pig in a poke - all you can try. </seg>
<seg id="696"> I am a potential customer, not just buy - we &apos;re going into the woods with the seller, there is a target set. </seg>
<seg id="697"> &quot;They give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I make sure that the weapon has a good start to bargain,&quot; - describes the procedure for the expert. </seg>
<seg id="698"> Shop on the couch </seg>
<seg id="699"> Web search engines lead out to the sites and groups in &quot;Vkontakte&quot;, which offers to buy weapons &quot;for different purposes.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="709"> I have heard of such schemes : &apos;s usually registered beyond Russian laws. </seg>
<seg id="710"> People take orders. </seg>
<seg id="711"> The buyer shall pay a cash machine. </seg>
<seg id="712"> &quot;In response, send a photo and instructions, where weapons were hidden,&quot; - says the press- secretary of the organization &quot;Right to Arms&quot; Dmitry sour. </seg>

<seg id="722"> In the U.S., workers are on strike fast food and supermarkets </seg>
<seg id="723"> Through working at the cash register, &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; is held up to a quarter of all American teens </seg>
<seg id="724"> In recent days, in America, a wave of protests against low wages in the corporate department stores Walmart and restaurants popular fast food chains, such as &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot;, &quot;Burger King&quot;, &quot;Taco Bell&quot;, &quot;Wendys&quot; and &quot;Kentucky Fried Chicken&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="725"> While no one can predict whether this will turn into a wave in the ninth wave or it is destined to fizzle out in the early stages. </seg>
<seg id="726"> Shares support trade unions and a number of left -governmental organizations. </seg>
<seg id="727"> In addition to increasing the modest salaries who receive ordinary workers of Walmart and fast food to the organizers of the protests is to create them in the trade unions. </seg>
<seg id="728"> While this sector is almost covered by the trade union movement. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 cents a year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> Stocks began last week after Thanksgiving, in the so -called &quot;Black Friday&quot; when America has fallen orgy giveaways, seized millions of ordinary people, and sometimes accompanied by clashes. </seg>
<seg id="731"> On this day, some workers corporation Walmart, which employs around the world 2.2 million people have left their jobs and picketed together with the trade unions and left-wing activists Stores Corporation, whose product is targeted at people modest and moderate means. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart sells everything, from diapers, hunting rifles and automotive batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Products in its stores an average of 8% to 27% cheaper than the large supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> Therefore, many low-paid workers only Walmart outfit at work. </seg>
<seg id="735"> The availability and range of products made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods podeshevke partly because few pays its employees. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The latter are also complaining about the poor working conditions, such as the lack of lift trucks or hand-held scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> The protesters in the &quot;Black Friday&quot; required to raise the salary and lamented the fact that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation, has jumped from 30 to 100 dollars a month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> The typical worker Walmart, receiving 9.5 per hour, this cost is too expensive, they said. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley, argue that if Walmart srednuyuyu salary increase to$ 12 per hour, it would cost corporations$ 3.2 billion. </seg>
<seg id="741"> This is about 1.1% more than it spends on salaries now. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If Walmart completely shift the wage increase on the shoulders of buyers, each visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more. </seg>
<seg id="743"> For the year, they will spend some of 12.39 dollars more than they are now. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Supporters of Walmart rather point out that the protests have taken place only in nine states and did not cause any corporation maleyschego damage. </seg>
<seg id="745"> &quot;Black Friday&quot; continued its stores from 8:00 pm Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that time, Walmart was selling about 5,000 items per second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> In total, its cash registers made in the &quot;Black Friday&quot; almost 100 million transactions. </seg>
<seg id="747"> Corporation representative Dan Fogelman argued in an interview with the left site Huffington Post, that jobs have left a total of &quot;at least five&quot; employees of Walmart, and that the protest was merely &quot;another public relations gimmick&quot; has organized its union. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;Free Cash!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> Protests continued this week in New York, where they were not subject to department stores Walmart (them in this progressive city do not favor, and why they are so far), and &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; and other cheap restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> McDonald&apos;s says it is selling billions of servings, and then it does not even give you a hospital and does not pay you for your honest work! </seg>
<seg id="751"> Dzhumeyn Williams, a member of the City Council of New York </seg>
<seg id="752"> At the moment, the minimum wage, according to the federal and New York law, is 7.25 dollars an hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> Fast-food restaurants over time it increases, but not by much, and the average of their rank and file workers receive in New York 8.90 dollars an hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Fewer them in this expensive city does not earn one. </seg>
<seg id="755"> How can you be in New York for the money, to me incomprehensible. </seg>
<seg id="756"> Once through the &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; was held almost a quarter of American teenagers who worked part time for their stalls after school while living with his parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Few people saw this as the main source of food, or planning to stay there for long. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Now I constantly come across an interview with the workers &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot;, who complain that they must live on this salary, and sometimes even to feed her children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, in our Wall Street Journal&apos;s hanging a comment, the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children, if you do not know what you feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> The participants of the protests, which began at 6.30 am on Thursday at the &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks fast-food began to pay at least$ 15 per hour, that is, more than doubled their the current minimum wage. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They also demanded that in the field of fast food have been set up trade union organizations. </seg>
<seg id="762"> U.S. law prohibits the administration of this discourage and punish activists union movement chicanery and layoffs. </seg>
<seg id="763"> On the other hand, the administration rarely makes them life. </seg>
<seg id="764"> But unionization fast food is difficult and for objective reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> One of the most important - an extraordinary turnover. </seg>
<seg id="766"> dissenters </seg>
<seg id="767"> Noisy protests took place on that day and a number of other cheap restaurants of Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The culmination of the campaign was in the middle of the day rally at the &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; near Times Square, with performances by several local Democratic politicians, in particular, a member of the City Council Dzhumeyn Williams, who said : &quot;McDonald&apos;s,&quot; says he sells billions of servings, and then he does not even give you a hospital and does not pay you for your honest work &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="769"> The demonstrators were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for mayor, Bill de Blasio, who said that &quot;we must join together in support of the fast-food workers, so that they have achieved pay equity, and economic prosperity, which deserves every New Yorker&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="770"> Described the incident as a New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the U.S. sphere of fast food. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But it involved only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of fast food service, which in New York employ tens of thousands of people. </seg>
<seg id="772"> It is unclear whether this will generate a spark of the flame of a mass movement. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;As long as the brain receives an average deceive&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> Popular among fans of modern technology theme augmented reality recently accepted to perceive primarily through the prism of special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> First summer at its annual conference, a working model showed Google, and then in November, it was reported that an application for a patent filed and the appropriate Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="776"> However, from a conversation with the head of a group of interactive 3D- technology in the Cambridge lab Microsoft Shahram Izadi that for scientists the company points - passed stage. </seg>
<seg id="777"> They are attracted by the prospect of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, creating virtual public spaces. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - Tell us, please, in general terms, what your research group? </seg>
<seg id="779"> - We are engaged in human-computer interaction, but at the same time trying to push the boundaries of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> While stuck in the mass of humanity on the stage of the pixels on a flat screen, sometimes finger -pointing at them. </seg>
<seg id="781"> We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and to anticipate major changes in this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the Xbox and sensors Kinect - this is a step forward, and almost no one today without the Xbox Kinect is not for sale, because we all wonder gesture control. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - What else lies ahead? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - Despite the fact that interactions Kinect transferred to the physical layer, much still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> Entering information improved (the system gets more data) and the output is not very much. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change that, working on a true three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including projective. </seg>
<seg id="787"> Be released into our computer world, physical, make it more tangible. </seg>
<seg id="788"> For this, however, you need to recognize not only the user, but also the space around it. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Then we can add real world of virtual objects in a much more convenient form. </seg>
<seg id="790"> And in the first place - to hell with those stupid helmets virtual reality! </seg>
<seg id="791"> - What do you think about voice control? </seg>
<seg id="792"> Hot stuff, but do not overestimate it be? </seg>
<seg id="793"> - It certainly can not be considered a panacea - there is a question of privacy, because I do not always want to inform others about their actions and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, all forms of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own niche. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project in which we were thinking about gestures, but not over the sweeping, but at such meager, short. </seg>
<seg id="796"> At the same gestures taken not camera device and a wrist bracelet that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> As long as it&apos;s big, but theoretically it is possible to reduce the size of a wristwatch. </seg>
<seg id="798"> But in general, the future is a mixed type of control, such as a gesture + voice. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - How&apos;s that? </seg>
<seg id="800"> - For example, how do you ask me to give you this can of soda? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You say, and at the same time show. </seg>
<seg id="802"> - I usually just saying. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize. </seg>
<seg id="804"> - So you want to force users to adapt to what can or can not at this time machine? </seg>
<seg id="805"> - It is not necessary, but it is a mutual rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think in the near future we basically have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will define more accurately the human response. </seg>
<seg id="807"> This may be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution in depth, it is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - If you talk about your work with sensors Xbox Kinect, which you claim to modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> Not enough resolution, depth, or something else? </seg>
<seg id="810"> - In principle, the current generation - is something from which you can make a start in our work over the three-dimensional scanner. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f / s. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But the point is not in the megapixels, but as a template and depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> On the latter point of view all of the current technology is not good enough for us - it&apos;s more work for designers of algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="814"> That is, we must remember not only about the resolution in the X and Y, but also Z. </seg>
<seg id="815"> Also important is the speed, the number of frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="816"> Human movement is quite dynamic, and the current 30 f / s frankly not enough, especially for the gesture. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Steven Betishes Redmondskoy from our laboratory did touch sensor with adjustable delay processing - from 1 to 100 ms, the current serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator. </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not everyone understands how it affects the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="819"> I would be in my line of work is very handy equivalent of such a device, not requiring touches to FPS was more. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - A number of cameras increase is not necessary? </seg>
<seg id="821"> - In the Kinect now has three &quot;camera&quot;, one of which is actually - infrared emitter, and the second - the receiver of the reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> And here is the third camera - this is actually a common sensor in the visible range. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It does not apply to determine the depth of the object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> Potentially more cameras could solve the problem... </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or exacerbate it by increasing the required amount of calculations. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be nice to create a flexible analogue of Kinect, play around with the location of the curvature of the camera and see how it will help in determining the three-dimensional position. </seg>
<seg id="827"> - As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, is not presented to the public its points. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Do not you think that in terms of everyday use of augmented reality glasses - this is one of the most promising platforms? </seg>
<seg id="829"> - Of course, all the while walking around, holding a smart phone in his raised hands, not very comfortable, but that&apos;s what I think : the coolest option would be &quot;passing&quot; augmented reality, when based on cloud platform you could switch from glasses to a smartphone, Head-Up Display and then everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="830"> Points - a very personal device, this is their strength (private things only visible to you), and weakness at the same time - based on augmented reality glasses will not allow you to work on the virtual objects shared with other people. </seg>
<seg id="831"> - Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only Tony Stark in &quot;Iron Man,&quot; but a mere mortal. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is one issue that is often pointed criticism of this idea : no tactile review! </seg>
<seg id="833"> Hands feel nothing! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What are the answers to your group is preparing for the challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - In my lectures I often say that augmented reality - this is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think it could well be the eighth addition of tactile sensations. </seg>
<seg id="837"> In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks - the use of the second hand as a unique substrate for the image. </seg>
<seg id="838"> She is an excellent record pressing! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are technologies that are really aimed at making it here &quot;pictures in the air,&quot; tangibility - for example, the interference of multiple ultrasonic beams directed at a specific point where the finger, gives a sense, but so far it is very weak - as if you blew on the pads. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There are bracelets on the wrists that affect the nerves in the fingers - also a promising direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - Are you trying to fool the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> Make him think that he feels that must feel like at that moment, when he sees something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> - That &apos;s a good idea, we have not tried to do so. </seg>
<seg id="844"> Here lies another problem, on which have to fight for a long time - how to make a person physically located in a very confined space, to believe that he is on the open, almost endless - and are working on the concepts of cross-country tracks (not like in the clubs), moving platforms, and huge balls. </seg>
<seg id="845"> While deceive the brain receives an average, much work remains for many years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> That&apos;s what makes working on a virtual reality so attractive for researchers - many things in a totally rudimentary. </seg>
<seg id="847"> Vkusovschina instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> &quot;Rosbalt&quot; continues the project &quot;St. Petersburg avant-garde&quot;, dedicated citizens who are ahead in the forefront of art and culture. </seg>
<seg id="849"> At the top list of figures already got bright art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements extend beyond the city, often finding acceptance in Europe, bypassing wide fame. </seg>
<seg id="850"> New hero &quot;Rosbalta&quot; - flamboyant artist Kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The whole town knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man dressed all in red, which is found then the Russian Museum, then at the Summer Garden, then on the opening days and trendy hangouts. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Picture of Cyril Miller always attract crowds wherever they were not exposed. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Cyril Miller - one of St. Petersburg purely social and philosophical storytellers, creators of new mythologies. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Cyril Miller - a bright man Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80 &apos;s - early 90&apos;s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> In addition, he is a man of the city, its appearance on the streets calling smile from citizens, lifting the entire mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> He recently have taken up the barrel organ and organ-grinder was St. Petersburg, as ripe for this challenging role of all its bohemian existence, philosophy and image. </seg>
<seg id="857"> - Cyril, and why are you still walking around the city in all red instead of yellow or turquoise, for example? </seg>
<seg id="858"> - I chose the color red as a fashion designer, dealing views and image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world of red color - it&apos;s a compromise between the artist, image maker and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Although in a society that is not just a little gray, causes aggression and agitation unkind properties. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocations aimed at making conversation started. </seg>
<seg id="862"> The whole history of my provocative actions - an invitation to debate. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - And when did you realize you have to be an artist? </seg>
<seg id="864"> - The exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where they were exhibited my work. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I realized that this was my path. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then a wave of old free unofficial artists spent, the new, free like me were not clear. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with postgazonevschinoy that led to the &quot;Pushkin -10&quot; and larger waves were not. </seg>
<seg id="868"> Throws me to the theater, clothing, music, of all genres, except for the word. </seg>
<seg id="869"> - And it all came together in your art- clinic... - It was important to find yourself in the culture center of St. Petersburg, where the need to gather all the best creative force. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995, I took the territory of the Pushkin -10, and there has not been repair, there was musical entertainment club, Bohemian Club, home of the St. Petersburg bohemia. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many were born there : Bromeliad, Tequila jazz, remember Schnur led to the project, &quot;Van Gogh&apos;s Ear.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="872"> Cord and his friends sang songs under the plywood lungs, they were in tight leotards, among them was the now fashionable composer Igor Vdovin. </seg>

<seg id="879"> In 2000, the survey was in the press, the prize was &quot;The people of our city.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="880"> In the &quot;Artist of the Year&quot; was named I ended my climax. </seg>
<seg id="881"> In the new times under the old rules uncomfortable to work, I&apos;m a man of truth, honesty, and culture of the past century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> In our years of easy to become popular, but the culture and the popularity of shared, can be popular, but not very cultured. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - Your work is inherent in a recognizable manner. </seg>
<seg id="884"> - Many of my paintings - it hits, they clearly expressed the urgency and severity. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I will have a program exhibition, &quot;Russian Museum in the Clowns.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="886"> Clowns - timeless category. </seg>
<seg id="887"> I used the social one, but now to be so - it&apos;s painful and scary. </seg>
<seg id="888"> But clowns smeared all, the tragedy is removed. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love the grotesque, I have a grotesque idea. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, save the world by changing the totalitarian by fiat. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Now on clothes meet, focusing on the mechanics of external rather than internal man. </seg>
<seg id="892"> Or maybe he can not apply his hand and spit in his face should be. </seg>
<seg id="893"> And cheating will be removed by changing clothes. </seg>
<seg id="894"> - And recently, we saw you in the role of urban organ grinder. - Cultural city should have such a hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who else but me to be. </seg>
<seg id="896"> - Well, maybe commercial art can be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> - Now commercial art should be neat, considerate, sweet. </seg>
<seg id="898"> There is a disintegration of cultures. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Earlier, people get in packs, bohemians loved one, simpletons more. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Now everything is split into microcommunity, it is difficult to please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I&apos;m not a hundred dollar note to please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Now we need to think who will like it. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Now everyone has a cult hero of 100 fans. </seg>

<seg id="905"> - It accounts for broshenki there sex - social sector work. </seg>
<seg id="906"> And on cultural grounds 300 people come, and 10 million will not come, and end up with less management, money, everything withers. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have fans, the main thing - they do not cheat, do not mess up their belongings. </seg>
<seg id="908"> I wrote in my youth such pictures that are a collector on the wall next to Falk and Larionov were hung. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with the paintings, which usually ends. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Now often confuse the terms. </seg>
<seg id="911"> They say, spiritual culture, the culture of consumption. </seg>
<seg id="912"> There is no culture in consumption, is another story. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a man of culture yesterday, rose examples of artists who have lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused the money for the sake of drawing pictures. </seg>
<seg id="914"> I am here for such a culture. </seg>
<seg id="915"> - Cyril, what is missing Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="916"> - Good cultural experts. </seg>
<seg id="917"> There is such a thing : an official from the culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not all of them can be engaged in culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> With the right kings were not so, the kings, maybe not very understanding in culture, but they understand that you need to keep the right experts. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Here in Moscow now good consultants. </seg>
<seg id="921"> We have people in St. Petersburg, which might be experts, but they are pushed as needed higher experts who will correctly evaluate these experts and will give way to them. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Now thriving vkusovschinka. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same Erarta, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all contemporary art we make, there are artists who have to look for other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> - What is right for you - St. Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="925"> - St. Petersburg - is not a cultural capital of culture in Moscow is much more soil there is. </seg>
<seg id="926"> And on the rocks of our art is difficult to grow. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need a cultural soil, and we have now more writers than readers, this is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="928"> In Europe a lot of people curious. who go to exhibitions, concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> We did this layer is thin. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We need to make a fashionable art, as it was in the beginning of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> The project was implemented with the grant of St. Petersburg </seg>
<seg id="932"> Give birth in space </seg>
<seg id="933"> Earth is in danger. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Global warming, or a collision with a killer asteroid. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Caravans spacecraft with earthlings on board to go and find a spare planet. </seg>
<seg id="936"> To save humanity, the main question arises as to continue his race in zero gravity or on the same spare the planet? </seg>
<seg id="937"> I think the choice is limited. </seg>
<seg id="938"> In fact, only two of these planets, which can absorb at least hypothetically. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;It&apos;s Venus and Mars&quot; - says a senior researcher at the State Astronomical Institute of the PK Sternberg (SAI) Vladimir Surdin. </seg>
<seg id="940"> But if the conditions on Mars more habitable, on the surface of Venus - a temperature of 500 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="941"> You can live only at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> Address the issues of reproduction in space began with the flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> Half a century ago, have conducted experiments on plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Four generations of peas grown in orbit did not differ from their terrestrial varieties. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Then - the elimination of insects in orbit, the tiny fruit flies, fruit flies. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979 he was sent into space quail eggs, to check how the embryo develops in conditions of weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="947"> We get the output is normal chick. </seg>
<seg id="948"> But then the problem begins. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;The problem with the fact that this chick has to find its feet, it should stand on their feet and start moving,&quot; - says the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP), Russian Academy of Sciences Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="950"> Finding no support, the chicks randomly tumbling. </seg>
<seg id="951"> And after 10 hours in neonates there is a complete atrophy of the instincts. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The chicks did not respond to light and sound. </seg>
<seg id="953"> And there&apos;s trouble was that after four days they just died. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;And the two times we hatch chicks, then abandoned, because there simply is not possible to work with them,&quot; - says the failure of the experiment with chicks in space, Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="955"> With animals the last time a biological &quot;minikovcheg&quot; flew into orbit 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> In the spring of 2013 the research continues. </seg>
<seg id="957"> However biosatellite &quot;Bion&quot; will only same-sex individuals. </seg>
<seg id="958"> Was an experiment with rats that were sent into space with the fetus. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, there have not found anything supernatural. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;It&apos;s just been on bio-satellites, but again - it is a single experiment, and such studies should be carried out,&quot; - said Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After landing, the cosmic offspring of rats appeared. </seg>
<seg id="962"> But to approach the problem directly in the space of reproduction has not yet obtained. </seg>
<seg id="963"> Not an easy task. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Animals, losing, familiar surroundings, simply can not realize their sexual instinct. </seg>
<seg id="965"> The man, in contrast to the little animals, in principle, it can. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and are able to create a fitting emotional backdrop. </seg>
<seg id="967"> For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But the woman in space fly for 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The biggest risk was in Tereshkova. </seg>
<seg id="970"> And the most precious thing a human - is the female body. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could say : does it after a flight into space. </seg>
<seg id="972"> Will she give birth to a child after the flight. </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;After all, the question no one answered,&quot; - says the veteran space industry Vakhtang Vachnadze. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, just one year after the flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The child&apos;s father Andrian Nikolayev was also an astronaut. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988 the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, two visits to the orbit, and even work in an open space, a son. </seg>
<seg id="977"> However, the risk remains. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We have a few units there are astronauts who, after long flights all cost, and growing a healthy generation. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;And if more, it is dangerous even at orbital flights&quot; - sums up the pilot- cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov. </seg>
<seg id="980"> And yet, humanity needs to look for some new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, the creation of artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="981"> Hydrolaboratory CPC - a mandatory stage of preparation for the flight. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here in zero buoyancy skills astronauts work out in the open space. </seg>
<seg id="983"> Water simulates weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> If an adult water, albeit comfortable, but still hostile environment, for infants - native element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> Small Ihtiandra seem to confirm - life on dry land out of the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> There is a connection between what the baby is about 9 months in my mother&apos;s okoplodnoy fluid, then it is easier to get used to some water. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle, it is logical because from birth, from the moment of the first bath, passes only 2 weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;It is not enough to forget something,&quot; - says Marina swimming instructor grudnichkovye Aksenov. </seg>
<seg id="989"> In short, if the unborn child more natural state of weightlessness, for women - need gravity, the force of gravity. </seg>
<seg id="990"> Very quick in weightlessness dryahleyut abdominal muscles, pelvis, falls ability to expulsion of the fetus. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Well, we drop it and relying on stimulants labor. </seg>
<seg id="992"> You can, of course, in a special chamber to go to give birth, she will push him. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;And then what?&quot; - Specifies the non-trivial questions Valeri Polyakov. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand, the child also need artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Not feeling the gravity, the body will form the skeleton and muscular system. </seg>
<seg id="996"> Newborn in orbit is not possible, as an adult, to put in a special pull-up suit for training. </seg>
<seg id="997"> It will just be deprived of what it will be vital. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;And this experiment that we &apos;ll go with you, allowing the birth of a child in an alien environment, will lead to what we bring to Earth a disabled person, completely perplexed man&quot; - predicts the head of the committee on bioethics IBMP RAS Igor Pestov. </seg>
<seg id="999"> While the birth of children in space - a question of theory. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> However, after a while it will be a reality when the humans on their ships will go to a distant planet, which will be home to their descendants born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> Head of the Main Control and Revision Office : Checking Schwarz - system failure caused by politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> In the field of public procurement Czech Republic has good control authorities, and despite the availability of high-quality legislation is lagging behind in its application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> This statement Miroslav Kala, Vice -President of the Supreme Audit Office, in an interview for the site Aktu√°lnƒõ.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;The law will never be perfect, but it must be used correctly, which, in my opinion, we do not have,&quot; - commented on the current situation of Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> Similar findings provide joint inspection of the Czech and German regulatory authorities. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> As an example of improper practices lead Petr Necas approach to the so -called Schwarzschild system. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) will not bother business checks - it is banned or allowed? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;Law should be established by any means, and if it prohibits something, then the prime minister can not resist the work of the institutions that are charged with the duty to inspect and ensure fulfillment of the obligations&quot;, - says Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At a meeting of the Audit Committee of the Chamber of Deputies did you talk about a joint project between the Czech and German sides, under which it is associated public procurement legislation of both countries. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What exactly was it? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> This refers to the parallel testing, we started probably two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Simply put, the question of what the European legislation states how public procurement should take place, followed by the national legislation and then also applied in practice. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> All information has been gathered and, even more unfinished check, showed interesting differences - in other words, the legislation we may be &quot;highly accurate&quot;, but in practice we use in some respects inferior to Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> It follows that it is insufficient to create increasingly sophisticated rules need to focus on the application of the law itself. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> And actually how the project can help you he means to you? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> Such joint control can contribute to the efforts to stop clarify the laws, reduce and improve the limitations because it does not lead to positive results. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> Economy means that the related things for a reasonable (but not necessarily low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But the fact that we will achieve this by reducing the limit orders. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> Perhaps this system will overflow &quot;papers&quot; so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system, will find them much more easily than if the limit is not reduced. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You talk about the internal problems of practical application of the law on public procurement. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> And as a system of control in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Whether there exists such an organization as our KRU (Audit Bureau), or does it work differently? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> For institutions, there as our KRA stands Bundesrechnungshof, hosted by our principle, there is also a board that works a little differently, but in general the two institutions operate similarly. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> In addition, the powers to a certain extent similar to, but because Germany has a federal structure, there is a division of audit and at the level of the federal states - that their system is somewhat different from ours. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> BRH could only manage federal money, we have the public funds. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the federal Court of Auditors. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> With regard to local laws, there are simpler than ours? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> Actually, I would not want to compare without concrete data, but in some ways Germany could be taken as a model, but you can definitely say that it is better at everything. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> This is so because they are better able to cope with the control? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> Definitely not, but again, I do not like such comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> But I must say that even exemplary countries face many challenges. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise, they would not receive any benefits from the cooperation with our office, right? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> Speaking of domestic legislation, the impact on both your facility amendments to the Law on Public Procurement, somehow manifest the consequences? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> Given that the validity of these amendments is rather short, it has not manifested itself in our works to control. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> Since we do in fact control, it is necessary to take into account some delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> Take it into account only in the preparation of future inspections - we started using our new tool &quot;detection risk uneconomical&quot; through which we drove nearly 14,000 government contracts. We have analyzed them. There is, of course, these changes will occur, because the restrictions are changed, changed the terms of certain types of tenders and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Do you think that the approval of this law will benefit or an additional load on the system of bureaucracy? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope this is confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> A problem that may arise is that the rules &quot;tougher&quot; and can not be observed. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> In operation, the previous rules controlled entities are tied with the supplier (for example, the regional operational programs - with the regional council) that any failure to comply with the public procurement law is a violation of fiscal discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> Whether it is necessary in this case to tighten the law in such a way? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I do not think this way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but do not punish those who commit a formal error that does not affect the decision. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system would only create more pressure on the bureaucracy. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> And then how to get out of this situation? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Let us realize that this path does not lead anywhere. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> Recently, the Prime Minister said that the GFC will not bother business checks so-called Schwarzschild system. What does this mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> &quot; Schwarz- system &apos; liens or enabled? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law should be installed in any way, and if it prohibits something, then the prime minister can not resist the work of the organs, which is charged with the duty to inspect and to enforce obligations. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> You can say, &quot;We will change the law and solve it,&quot; but we can not say that we will pretend that nothing is happening. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The Law on Public Procurement has pretty strict rules, as well as what should be formal, and rightly so. This will protect the public procurement. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But, on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal defects. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but it must be used correctly, which, in my opinion, we do not have. </seg>

<seg id="1140"> Are you planning any such &quot;grand event&quot; in the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In May, we will for the first time at the festival &quot;Prague Spring&quot; and then, of course, prepare an interesting program with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Next year, we &apos;d love to spent representation in the Czech national home in New York, and I personally, so if we are in the United States, would very much like to speak in Washington, DC and Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> About abroad you have serious plans, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> Group The Tap Tap - a group of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How do you deal with the way in terms of organization and logistics? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It&apos;s not as scary as it seems at first glance. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> We have five members on electric wheelchairs, strollers they have to travel in the baggage compartment, plus the entire large amount of cargo and boxes of tools. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> Nevertheless, while coping with it without problems. ƒåSA Czech Airlines and British Airways British Airways has always been excellent for us prepared, that I wondered how many times. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where we have recently returned, everything went without any problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Due to travel abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes towards persons with disabilities and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> With what you&apos;ve come across so far? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything is functioning better than us, in Russia, we have seen that in the east is still at a basic level. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Compared with Prague in Moscow, a lot of barriers, and there is still a novelty independent movement of people on the electric wheelchair in the center of the city. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> Also, there is not a course of such trivial things as to give way to a disabled person in the elevator. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, there are already having social organizations that are trying to draw people&apos;s attention to the problems of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> And what, on the contrary, we constantly have to catch up with the advanced countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are so many things, the level of performance that far behind. </seg>
<seg id="1158"> But it is important to clarify that the improvement and the improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of the people concerned. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid, it is normal that people with severe disabilities to move independently in the streets may go to the bathroom in the museum, but where you want... </seg>
<seg id="1160"> There&apos;s not very common that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in public life, in which we do with The Tap Tap a little ahead! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> Respect for the public or Accessibility - is one thing, but at a time when we will be among the famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, when it all really starts to change. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> While these are isolated cases - people with a strong will. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The Tap Tap Group is currently very popular, but will return two years ago, which in 1998 made you organize it? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I went to college Edlichki as an educator, I was around a lot of young people who wanted to do something. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And since I am a musician and I play including the saxophone, then together with a colleague organized a fun musical circle. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> Well, over time, says our lead Ladya Angeloviƒç, it&apos;s a little out of hand (laughs). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> Popularity also came only in the last few years, or am I confusing you? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It&apos;s true, it helped that we started to join the famous singers and actively work on the promotion of the group. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We came to the conclusion that the work that no one can appreciate, in fact does not seem to exist. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to the funds of the European Union, we can not afford qualified teachers, equipment, and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> If you stood in front of the goal as well unleash The Tap Tap? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the beginning I felt their potential ability to do something extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> In show business is full of things, imitating one another. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> This is logical, everything new is taken with care, and it lasts a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Tap Tap one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression of a person who sees us, of course, sorry, it&apos;s natural... </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But the pity is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering from some and abandoned by all individuals, we need to spare. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> They are the people who can live a full life and grow, of course, only if they have the necessary resources. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I say that if people with disabilities get something, it is a shift not only for them but for the whole society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> Has the success that you are a strict leader, how many of you think? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If we want to do quality work, we must be uncompromising in many things and keep some discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> But I think it&apos;s fine. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people come to us with a romantic view and fly in the clouds, and when they find out that two times a week they have to go to rehearsal, attend training courses and spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose their enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> But it happens in any group that wants to work hard and achieve something. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> Currently, the group The Tap Tap twenty people. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> How many were there at the start in 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Only one Ladya Angeloviƒç. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are an open group of people come and go, it can not be prevented. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> For those who have the desire and willpower, our doors are always open. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> The concert will take place in Prague at the stadium Incheba, in Brno - the club Fl√©da and Ostrava - Plynojem in the center with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1192"> At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected Telemachus at the time of a song of The Tap Tap &quot;End of the World is canceled.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The purpose of this project - to collect funds in the amount of 25 million euros for the purchase of multi -barrier equipment for an educational center at the Institute STUDEO Edlichki in Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> Concert ticket costs 400 euros for children under 12 years free admission. Tickets can be purchased in advance at Bohemiaticket. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Poland and space. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Last week at a meeting of the European Space Agency, Poland adopted the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA 12 September 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland began to work closely with the ESA in 1994, and in subsequent years has actively participated in several projects of the agency. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> But the road to space Poland began much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Even before the Second World War, Polish enthusiasts involved flights into space, but this is not always met with understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I recall, for example, a lecture by Sternfeld, which is December 6, 1933 presented in the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory ideas of his groundbreaking work, &quot;Introduction to the space program.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1201"> Ideas of a young engineer (b. 1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years of Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Ian Gadomskii was interested in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> In 1934, France won the Sternfeld, Robert Esnault- Pelterie and Andre Luis Hirsch for &quot;Introduction to the space program.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Dr. Ian Gadomskii (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, and later became a great promoter of astronomy and space exploration. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> He has published in Polish magazines hundreds of articles and has written a number of books devoted to these disciplines. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomskii became known global advocate of space, and his contribution has been assessed, including the fact that one of the craters on the Moon was named in his honor. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> Already in 1925 in Poland was built railway trolley, equipped with a rocket engine. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Unfortunately, the author of this idea remains unknown, as well as details of the project. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> Not even clear for acceleration or deceleration for the trolley was to be used rocket. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> Information about this trolley is known only from the press of that era. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> Since 1933, the Polish artillery began to think about the missile booms. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The study carried out by the Section of weapons technology collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Volfke and Gustav Mokzhitskim. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> Of the remaining material can be seen that the study reached the stage of practical tests. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> But with the arrival of German troops was interrupted. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937, specialized in printing the idea of photovoltaic missile destroyer, which was proposed by the engineer Rohozynsky, and the following year came the work &quot;air missile and torpedo aircraft missile - bomb&quot; &apos;s Leliv - Kzhivoblotskogo. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Both projects were developed for military use rocket engines. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Before the war, all the projects of the military use of rocket technology involved Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), who coordinated all the work. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The Committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of operation, the work ended because of the war. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> Next scientific papers on aerospace, appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="1219"> First of society mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the journal &quot;Problems&quot;, which publishes four voluminous article in Astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> In one of them, Professor M. Subotovich offered to organize a society that is engaged in space activities. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> While projects are gaining momentum satellites, and it was clear that the space research - a promising industry. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish Society of Astronautics (PHA) was trying to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951), and the fall of the POA has been a full member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> And next year, the first chairman of the POA Kazimierz Zarankevich (1902 - 1959) became the deputy chairman of the International Astronautical Federation. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> In this position he remained until his death, which occurred in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> Since 1956, PHA has made a significant contribution to the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile, which carried out the research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first type RM- 1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> Missile capable to cover the distance of 1800 m, was a length of about 80 cm, and it weighs less than 5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> It was subsequently built an upgraded version of RM- 1A, and the summer of 1959 on a vacant lot Bledovskom tests were carried out two-stage RM- 2. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The missile has a length of about 1.4 m, and its weight was about 11.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> The next version of the missile has already been able to engage in real scientific work - RM- 34 rocket could not overcome 14.5 km, and its task was to monitor the high-altitude winds. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> But in 1962, further development was suspended. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> Heir of the first missiles began RM -1 Rocket Meteor, developed in the period between 1962 and 1965. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> The missile was designed as a two-step, its total length is 510 cm, and the initial weight - 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> Have developed three types (designated as Meteor- 1A - 1B and - 1C), which differ in size cameras for scientific equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> Meteor rocket - 1A possessed a space of 0.4 liters, Meteor- 1B - 0.34 L and Meteor- 1C - 0.62 l. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum range for all three types was 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> In the period between 1965 and 1968 was held at the Aviation Institute of Development Meteor -2 missile, and its first flight tests began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> Meteor -2 missile with a launch weight of 380 kg was able to bring a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Then were built version of the Meteor -2H and Meteor -3. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of the National Committee of COSPAR two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> In addition, the program Intercosmos, Poland participated in the exploration of outer space on the Soviet Satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Germashevsky interkosmonavtom was second after Vladimir Remek. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> Repeal of the law on public works - this is not the solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the law on public works. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> Ruling led to a lively debate in the community. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> Undoubtedly, it will be interesting to look at this from the perspective of a broader point of view. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> Liberal- oriented economic system in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> In essence, this means that some economic units national economic systems are in constant conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> This is due to the principle of free trade and free, unfettered movement of private capital with unbridled financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> As a result, a significant difference in the cost of labor (wages) there is price pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> Under this concept you need to understand the state when the manufacturer by delivering cheap goods tries to survive in the economic competition that &quot;knocks down&quot; the cost of competitor to pick up a larger share of the market and, thus, to increase their own income. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> In a large scale it is for most entrepreneurs or moving production abroad or cheap purchases abroad or disappearance. The result is increased unemployment in those countries where labor costs in comparison with other high. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> As the private equity does not assume any social responsibility, including produced them for unemployment, the inevitable increase government spending on social needs. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> In general, the situation reinforces the reluctance of Businesses pay taxes and thereby offset the public economic and social damage caused by them in the pursuit of profit. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to give specific statistics. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> Cavalier methods of private capital to create the level of individual economies situation where governments are forced to compete with each other to artificially reduce the social standards of their peoples in order to attract foreign capital. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, governments give to their own population to private capital, despite the social decay. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This is reflected primarily in changes in the law. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The goal is to get his people economically obey the dictates of private capital, particularly in the area of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> It operates as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool for cutting workers&apos; rights in the field of labor law. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> As a result of increased levels of poverty, and at the same time and the difference between the poor and the rich. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> In Germany, a few years there is a public distribution of food to the poor, who are unable to support themselves by their own labor. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of these people have already approaching one million. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> In order to improve the competitiveness of the German economy cases are constant when, employed people get a salary that the state should pay extra to them that they get a living wage. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> A similar scandal became known to the public in the case of additional workers Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> Economic measures in almost all the southern states of the EU, of course, lead to the same state in which people who are under pressure from a catastrophic collapse of the social status, or forced to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or exist on starvation wages on the margins of society in the hope that one day the country will private investment capital. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> However, one wonders how he will be taken? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If the funds are to come from other EU countries, the poverty to move from one country to the other, or he will not come at all, as the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, African is still working for the European share of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This applies to the whole of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Liberal theory and the media ad nauseam argue that the state can not participate in the capital of its own economy, which managed economy leads to economic disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Private equity insists on the fact that the state should not interfere in the actions of the managers of the economy. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Followed by the answer to the question does not apply to private capital, is now virtually controlling politics and that &apos;s the whole state, for their own selfish purposes? </seg>
<seg id="1272"> The unequivocal answer - yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The proof is the existence of a nearly omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all states. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> As a result we have a hopeless situation, manifested in corruption, ensuring the mutual benefits of the law, where almost all deserved to be punished, but not a crime. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany the situation is that government ministries because of a lack of funds entrusted draft legislation to private law firms that are closely linked to industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> Then Bundestag approves the bills. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> All power comes not from the people, as the Constitution of the Western type, and from the powerful financial groups, who prefer their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> It is obvious that the liberal- oriented democracy now quickly finds himself in a situation such as that described in the product Appiani &quot;The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey&quot;: &quot; The state has long been dissolved, and agencies engaged in violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Bribes, illegal obtaining favors with stones and swords. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> Bribery and corruption flourished without any restrictions, and people went to the polls to vote in advance sold &quot;&quot;... good people do not run for the post of governor in the end once the state for eight months left without consul&quot;....&quot;began in earnest say that the only salvation in this terrible situation is the autocracy and the need to choose an energetic man&quot;.. Appian thought it would be Pompeii, but he was Caesar, who eventually replaced by democracy autocracy. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> As in ancient times, in modern society is dominated by the interests of their own reckless, excluding the public interest. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Private capital is inherently not intended to be used for public purposes. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The current result is not different from the past: the unprecedented decline of the elite without any effort to reform the deeper nature. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> So the cause of the fascist and communist regimes, we should look for in a reckless liberalization of the economies of the 19th and 20th centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> To date, the lack of these regimes and the existence of a liberal type of democracy can be seen as a pause, after which the expected next round. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> First of all it is tragic that the current elite ignores the consequences of hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, human and social catastrophes that we are now seeing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new stories. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> Repeal of the law on public works is not the solution, or at least not permanently. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under the pressure of competition, both at the international and at the national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will have to continue to find ways to further reduce the social level of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> Thus, this trend is systemic. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the equity participation of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in the society to the state. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel : Laboratory of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> &quot;Out of the violence will not work, and can never get out&quot; - Sting song &quot;Fragile&quot;, where the main verse of the refrain are the words : &quot;Do not forget what we are fragile.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;If my sons did not want wars, they would not be&quot; - a dying Gutel Shnaper, Meyer Amschel Rothschild&apos;s wife. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, has caused a lot of feedback. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Some advocate for Israel, explaining its position that it has the right to self-defense, and the Palestinians act as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing that the Israeli state racism, genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is assigned the role of a terrorist state. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I do not want to speculate on who these recurrent waves of murders - the offender, the victim and who is, after all, today&apos;s citizens of Israel, including the self-governing territory, were born at the time of the current political situation, and did not witness the violence started. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> My goal - is to offer readers a peek behind the curtain to look at who primarily serve as a continuing tension already 95 years (counting from the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small plot of land in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> Some of my arguments are backed by historical facts, some of which are derived from my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of events in modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of mankind - is primarily a story of the struggle for power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> In each period, we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> What is not so clear - these people are always completely independently undertake their steps, or for their throne was someone who had directed their steps to the pre- established goals. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> It is necessary to admit that we live in a time when the world&apos;s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that the concentration of money and power arising out of them could not happen in a generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Among the astronomically rich family stands alone, which could be considered as the head of the octopus (do not know whether someone above them, but it is not excluded) - Rothschilds. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> About a lot of them do not write. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The first news agency (Reuters) they have bought in the 90s of the 19th century to stop the rumors linking them with the name of the criminal acts in the higher spheres, in the shadow of where they are, and have always led to the strengthening of their power, or the augmentation of wealth at the same time and besides, and more. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> They are large stakes in almost all the central banks of the world, and against countries whose central banks, they do not have their share, and they are preparing a war (before the invasion of Afghanistan was only 7 countries since the invasion of Iraq was the 5 countries after the overthrow of Gaddafi had only four, but at the same time, the Russian government took the central bank of the country in their hands.) </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Anyone who has tried to resist this family, died. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to maintain the status of the central bank for the Rothschilds Bank of America, during the Civil War, he began to produce their own (you know - the government) money and was killed in 1865 in the theater. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> John F. Kennedy began issuing their own money and wanted to cancel the FED (Federal Reserve System), was murdered in 1963. MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanted to sue the FED for unleashing the great economic crisis in 1929. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Their lust for world power during the period from 1859 to 1871 led to the development plan for three world wars created a great 33rd Freemason Albert Pike level. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The task of the first war was the destruction of monarchies in Europe, and the second was to destroy the colonial rule, especially the United Kingdom, and the third to reduce the world&apos;s population to about 0.5-1 billion people (as many slaves would be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury and they will not consume a lot of resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism can not be anything other than a pre-requisite for such a project), and the final seizure of absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method by which the working group of the wealthiest families, headed by the Rothschilds, is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent proposal of solutions (order ab chao - order out of chaos). </seg>
<seg id="1314"> But these solutions are false and will always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see bottom FED, which was to prevent a repeat of the crisis caused by them in 1907). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> Thus, after they managed to unleash the First World War by killing the Hapsburg heir to the Austro - Hungarian throne, Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Tsarist Russia, starting the Bolshevik revolyutsiiyu. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The First World War ended in a sudden, unreasonable in military and economic terms, the surrender of Germany (there was no need for war to destroy Czarist Russia) and, as a consequence, there has been fragmentation of the Central European powers, Austria- Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> To facilitate the outbreak of the Second World War, bankers and politicians have created a latent conflict situation, put it on a huge war reparations Germany than paved the way for the radicalization of the impoverished masses, then the Germans could only throw a strong enough convicting the guilty and offering simple solutions to the Leader, then a multinational Czechoslovakia with strong German minority, which was to play, and really played a function of the fifth column, for starting the fire of war. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds have provoked the base of the Zionist movement, one branch of which was trying to create a Jewish state, preferably in the field of historical Judea, with Jerusalem as its capital (the return to Zion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The aforementioned Balfour Declaration created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine began to happen the first clashes with the local Arab population. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> World War II broke out, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler had escaped from the chains in which he was initially kept the bankers, or whatever he did was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the preconditions for the recognition of the Jewish state by the international community. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked war reparations to the 2nd World War, the state of Israel was proclaimed, to create a center of war -third. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If the international bankers will be able to untie it, the Jewish people, as well as in World War II, becomes a victim of the fighting on the front lines, this time together with the Arabic or, more simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel - it&apos;s like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos, not only domestically but also internationally (just take a sharp division of the people into supporters and opponents of Israel.) </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is to blame and who is the victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in the endless chain of violence, if it all started with the greed of individuals and their aspirations to world power? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> It is necessary to distinguish between the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders because, like us, the international bankers shoved people to vote in the elections only their own candidates. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The current Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu&apos;s hawk is a typical example of the fascist loyal to the international bankers politician who does everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran&apos;s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan,...) will be threatened develop into a world conflict, and given control over Iran&apos;s Strait of Hormuz, containing 20% of the world&apos;s oil reserves (shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide) - also lead to the destruction of the world economy. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> In the light of what now appear the words spoken by David Rockefeller in 1994 : &quot;All we need - is a general crisis, and people will take a new world order.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1329"> The New World Order in their view - a world of masters and slaves. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> A world where the rest of the human population is a handful of the financial aristocracy, enjoying the comfort. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> A world where everyone is born with the birth of the body implanted chip, with whom he becomes a creature, is under total control. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> &quot; And it makes all the big and small, rich and poor, free and slave to have on his right hand or on his forehead mark, so that a person who is not marked the name of the beast, or the number of his name, he could neither buy nor sell. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> That&apos;s the wisdom: anyone with a mind can calculate the number of the beast. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> Because it corresponds to the name of men, and the number is - six hundred sixty-six. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> The film &quot;Operation&quot; Argo &quot; : When worse than ever, call Hollywood </seg>
<seg id="1336"> In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist student demonstrators seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution in the U.S. that have been the patron of his regime for decades. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> For the U.S. administration a positive outcome of the situation suggests that - she could not afford to throw overboard the Shah, because it is at the root of the allies could undermine confidence in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> However, to achieve the liberation of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution has led to the establishment of the theocratic regime, she was not able to. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by a failed attempt to free the hostages by force. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> Prisoners diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations brokered by the Government of Algeria. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Their fate sparked a wave of solidarity at home and anti-Iranian sentiment. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> Defeat in Iran has greatly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the presidential election of 1980, which ended the election of Ronald Reagan. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The film, srezhessirovanny actor Ben Affleck &quot;Operation&quot; Argo &quot; describes one of the episodes of the story that brought America small victories. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Shortly before the occupation of the Embassy of the six workers managed to escape. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> After they finished the complex twists and turns its way into the residence of the Embassy of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities managed to take them out of Iran, with the help cover extravagant legend, according to which they traveled on a Canadian passport as members of the film crew was looking for a place in the country for the filming of the sci-fi epic. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> The combination of genres </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The plan, which invented the expert on &quot;evacuation&quot; Tony Mendez, demanded cooperation Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> To the legend was true, in specialized journals written about the film project, arranged a press conference, a fictional manufacturing company has had a real office. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Details of the operation for a long time kept secret, the film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> Affleck movie - a special combination of several genres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called &quot;film - kinoopus&quot; the story of a successful venture, fraud - an example would be a series of films about the Ocean. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> In the film, constantly changing mood - on the one hand, the documented conceived scenes from Tehran (uncredited shows iconic historical photographs of events and how the same situations were shown in the movie - big differences to do so). </seg>
<seg id="1355"> On the other hand, lightweight Hollywood passages intersecting with irony and mild exaggeration. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> And then another scene from the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies - men in suits discussing the situation at the negotiating table, on the stairs of institutions on the phone... </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben Affleck remarkably managed to re-start a career. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> From ridiculed the actor has become a respected director, and his game has ceased to be an object of ridicule. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> &quot;Operation&quot; Argo &quot;is his third feature film, after the dark detective&quot; Gone Baby Gone &quot;(2007) and the thriller&quot; The City &quot; (2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At the same time, this is the first film Affleck, who starred in the director &apos;s hometown - Boston. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> A sense of the atmosphere at this place belongs to the qualities that have raised their earlier films directed by Hollywood over the standard. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> And it shows Affleck in &quot;Argo&quot;, where Tehran is &quot;playing&quot; Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the opening scene of the fall of the embassy is impressive with its clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unpredictability, which occur when somewhere suddenly changed history. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Similar effect Affleck and his colleagues reach the scenes of fictional (fake headquarters at the Tehran bazaar). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too many processes in too many places. </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director had to deal with the fact that the story does not involve many exciting scenes of cinematic value. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> It works quite well with this little, sometimes think up something - it all comes out not as elegant (the scene in which the phone call in America to prevent a looming crisis at the airport in Tehran, and the chase for the runway look pretty far-fetched.) </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The disadvantage of &quot;Argo&quot; is a distraction associated with the need to show too many events in too many places. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues are really very charming, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are in the movie are not the only ones. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Affleck&apos;s film lacks a bit of drama, this is a movie that you can watch with mild interest, assessing the staging and retro style, recreates the thrillers of the seventies. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> But captures the hard way. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> However, this is enough to remind you of the one still in a sense of living history, as well as evidence of how exaggerated idea of the all-powerful and all-knowing intelligence services. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Terms of inflating balloons, bananas and circus </seg>
<seg id="1374"> Portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, annually conducting a survey on the most absurd of bank charges, has now decided to announce a competition for &quot;the most absurd decision or project from the workshop of the EU.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1376"> Among the already nominated for the nomination absurdities - the recent decision of the European Court of association insurance rates for men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> Until now, women have the benefits of life insurance, because insurance companies to objectively they are less at risk. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> &quot;Further incredible ideas from the workshop of the EU can nominate people to the competition by the end of this year. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> Needless voting will take place until the end of February 2013, &quot;- said Nager. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> By orders of the controversial EU is, for example, and the mandatory addition of bio-components in the fuel, resulting in harm nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances directive or about the size of chicken cages, as a result of this year rose significantly eggs. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> Also criticized was subjected to a de facto ban on the use of the term &quot;butter for sandwiches&quot; or withdrawal from the market of classic light bulbs. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> Quality bananas should be a length of 14 centimeters. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> The pan-European unit often makes a decision under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are normally protected by a State or group of States (Czech Republic so now even threatened Council defends claims of its banks). </seg>
<seg id="1384"> Lobby interests are: for example, high -quality bananas in the European Union were to reach a length of 14 cm and did not dare to show &quot;abnormal curvature&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> In this case, the European Commission was justified by the fact that only harmonizes existing disparate national rules that complicate trade. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> EU, despite the opposition of some states, yet softened the standards for fresh fruit and vegetables, referring to the fact that the existing directive would lead to a dissipation of products. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> Candidate to win in a survey last year and could become the EU decision, under which sold balloons must be equipped with a warning that children under eight years can not inflate them without adult supervision. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The EU appealed to American studies, according to which the balloons in the game are a potential cause of child deaths by suffocation. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> Such a restriction would now apply to children under 14 years old, who are forbidden to blow into the fairground dudelki. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> Fun ideas are born at home </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Enough is absurd and rule on European officials themselves : anyone who has any official position of the European Union, can not, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece to use the name Macedonia, and should instead say &quot;FYROM&quot; (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). </seg>
<seg id="1392"> Bankovn√≠poplatky.com portal in collaboration with the association of liberal economists &apos; principle of non-interference &quot;(Laissez Faire), proposed to vote, in addition to the above a few absurd rules, such as the EU rules on the amount of food stocks in the membership of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU has set the maximum amount of food stocks, which may be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the date of its entry into the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, set the volume of canned mushrooms, for which she was threatened with a large fine. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The organizers of the questionnaire is also interested in the idea of paying for some countries, because they do not have the sea, and the idea of providing subsidies to the application for subsidy. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> But these ideas originated in Prague, not in Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;We are at a disadvantage because we do not have the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> The European Union will ask for compensation, &quot;- said the fall of 2004, the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (CSSD). </seg>
<seg id="1399"> As an argument, he pointed out that there was a high grain yield, and as a result of the so -called intervention purchases of state had warehouses full of inventory that was necessary to take out. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> For the fact that the Czech Republic is far from the port, the EU, according to Palacio, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> As a result, the European Commission has met the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Subsidies for subsidies offered villages Ministry of Regional Development, led by Minister Paul Nemets (US-DEU), in particular, the subsidy had to go on drawing up applications for subsidies from Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> EU : Bizarre orders are the exception </seg>
<seg id="1404"> Although the regulations in the Member States can easily become the target of criticism, the EU&apos;s efforts to regulate, as well as a more efficient operation and development of the European Union, according to many experts, deserve more recognition. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> A major problem, according to experts, is the scoop EU subsidies for projects that do not have even a hint of anything to do with the deepening of European integration, however, that Member States have made in the discussion of the budget. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> Evokes emotions of the Czechs and the fact that, as in other European Union countries, the Czech Republic has to fight in Brussels for the right to identify their specific traditional products, and it does not always win in this contest. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> Although the Czechs after six years of fighting, the Germans and the Austrians retained the name &quot;Olomouc cheese,&quot; but &quot;Tuzemsky rum&quot;, whose traditions in our country goes back to the 19th century, our producers have been renamed to &quot;Tuzemak.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Rum may be called only from cane distillate products and not from sugar beet. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> In the official list of registered products the EU, along with world-famous cheese &quot;feta&quot; and &quot;gorgonzola&quot;, marzipan from L√ºbeck German or parma ham, already proved, for example, Carlsbad crackers, and pogorzhelitsky T≈ôebo≈à carp and hops. </seg>

<seg id="1411"> People want me to be protected the republic, but I&apos;m a fan - says Okamura. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Mr. Senator, as a person comes to mind to run for president? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> I do not think about getting to become a senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If we all operated in the country without any problems, then I would not run anywhere. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I can not see how in the last 20 years, the country is stolen, as there are bustling thieves, people raise taxes and the retirement age. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> I had no ambition to be a politician. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> But when I see something that I do not like it, then try to find a solution how to change that. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And since I was forty years old and I am an independent person, not related to any party, I have no other opportunity to influence things, but to run for senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> In the Senate you have got, but soon went to the presidential castle. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Do not you turn around so his back to the people who you choose? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I kept saying that to join the struggle for the presidential castle depending on the result of the elections to the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Later, I said that if I selected a senator, I will run for president. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> My goal is not the position, position - a tool by which I can make their views. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> So I need the greatest impact and sweeping powers. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> But the difficulty is not only that we as a nation murmur at the bar or at the TV, but are willing to trample on anyone who tries to change something. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> Added to this are the media that denigrate human, and who confuse freedom of speech with freedom lies. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> For example, talking about me, that I give a bribe journalists, or that I was an adviser Jiri Paroubek. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Let us turn to your views. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> The struggle for the presidential castle you started with the thesis of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and on the inverse property declarations to the amount of above twenty million. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> To do this, you need to change the law. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> You as the president such authority is not, and only the whole Senate may propose laws. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How do you want to solve this problem? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> When I as a citizen lobbying is to conduct tours became free enterprise, it could promote. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem is politicking - when someone comes up with a good offer on the left or right, he intentionally obstruct, and this hinders citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As an independent non-party man I have much more potential for support from all parliamentary parties. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> My advantage is that I have no party unfolding on the shelves, without regard to the dogmas can take from each lot of what is best for our country, and to apply it. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> Do you consider yourself a person is more related to the right or to the left? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that the people I relate more to the left. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me it does not matter at all - a little bit to the left or to the right. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> For me it is important that we go forward. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> It is not about what someone refers to the right, and some to the left, I want to bring people together. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> I always will support any good solution to society, whether it will offer MHRC or GFC, and I &apos;ll just against bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> You get angry when someone says you&apos;re a populist. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But do not you prove it by what you said? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> When you create a business plan for a company, you also have some common goals and views. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> And to that you are trying to approach. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> You can call it populism, but all proposals of which I speak, are already in operation in the world, or talk about them eminent experts. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without the support of Parliament you will only slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> And with that in politics you will not last long. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Or do you think that when you go out to the people and talk to them, you will be able to implement criminal and financial responsibility? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no other option. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Only convincing politicians, journalists and the public, and try to lure them to his side, so that we succeeded. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> If I were elected president, I would not have been a problem to organize a live television broadcast in which I will refer to the chairpersons of the parliamentary parties with a call to legalize financial and criminal penalties for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> And they, in case of failure, will have to report, why do not. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> If there is a strong personality who will voice abuse, then we can put pressure on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Take the direct election of the president - it was the merit of public pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> I say outright that I am a lover, not a genius, and not intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> I try to look for allies to defend their beliefs and attitudes. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> I&apos;m just a beginner in politics, and for the program will try to get the support of the majority. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> Cause I &apos;m trying to promote yourself, in the event that it fails, six years later, finish and return to the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> It kind of sounds as if Okamura has to save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I do not no savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know the one I will not do anything, so I walked around a number of famous people with the offer to run for the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I went to Radim Yanchur, he refused due to the heavy workload. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> Well at least I supported the investigation leading journalist Ian Lorentsov, which revealed the fraud to light fuel oil. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> I put forward my candidacy because people are really dissatisfied, but now I feel I am on the scale. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty per cent of people did not go to the polls, and most of those who went to the representatives chosen establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> We are independent in the Senate only two. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> People chose the Senate so that the changes will be made to work. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Despite this, I will fight for their views, for example, the direct election of mayors and governors. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> You think about the basis of his own party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> That&apos;s what I still do not think because I do not have time to check the cleanliness of the past every potential supporter, and I do not have the money for it. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> There is no money in the presidential campaign, on my clear account only twenty thousand crowns. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> You have no money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> You&apos;re talking about property declarations, and how are your own thing with it? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> Private property is valued at approximately 60 million. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> I have a plot in Prague worth about 25 million to 10 million apartment, one apartment for 8 million art collection of about 10 million, the Aston Martin 3.5 million and Skoda Superb in a million, there is still a few million on the account. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> By the way Aston Martin I had, because it was my boy&apos;s dream - I&apos;ve always liked James Bond, who was driving the car, was gallant with women and at the same time fighting against the treachery and lawlessness. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> You &apos;re driving on the Aston Martin, own property by 60 million and you have no money for the campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You say you want to change the republic, but their own money to invest too much in it do not want. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> It&apos;s not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I do not have 15 million on the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> I have to get into debt? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> In the campaign I have already invested 2.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that I do not have sponsors, suggests that my program is not as interesting. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> And I do not have to pay for the campaign out of his own pocket. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> The cost of the campaign I basically cover the senatorial salary. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But for the money I would not have lived, for example, could not pay his son for the English school, which costs 30 thousand per month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If I only wanted to make money, so would not run anywhere. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> So then you&apos;re going to do business, so that you can live? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Did not you say that reduce this activity? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But it does not depend on the size of the salary. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As I promised, the activity I partially reduced. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, the managing director of a travel agency in the spring will be my deputy. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> People would like that I was bessrebrenniki that will keep the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But I also need to make a living. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> How, as an entrepreneur, you&apos;re used to receive monthly? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> From two hundred to four hundred thousand, and I get on. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> And if I were president, I would have finished my business. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> The full interview can be found in the Saturday edition of the newspaper &quot;Right.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1501"> MVRDV architects argue that real adventures are not only in the imagination - for example, Spijkenisse and its newly constructed Mountain Book - 2 photos </seg>
<seg id="1502"> &quot;I think this building is fun, it looks futuristic, finally, we can again see something interesting,&quot; - says Lisette Verhayg, people on the edge of the road. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> And Stephen Spermon, IT specialist at a nearby large company, said this: &quot;No, this building is really beautiful.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1504"> But I ask myself, why do we need today is another library? </seg>
<seg id="1505"> We all have the Internet, iPad and e-books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Today, no one willingly goes into such an old-fashioned library, right? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spijkenisse, maloprimechatelnomu couchette town near Rotterdam, belongs to an unusual record. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> Its population of 80,000 people has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> To combat this unfortunate circumstance a few years ago it was decided to contribute to the general education and to build seven fictional bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes in the form of beautifully painted miniatures of reinforced concrete. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of this educational initiative was modest. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> And then the city fathers realized that they remained the only way to overcome the statistics: build a library! </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Winy Maas of Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, master of bold bar charts and the author of witty, sometimes cynical buildings, took to the task with his usual equanimity and appeared at a competitive audition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while the jury looked puzzled and shrugged their shoulders, daring Maas resigned from his original gift pyramid in size and finished a speech in defense of his project as follows: &quot;Dear citizens!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1514"> Here it is, my suggestion: &quot;Book Mountain&quot; in Spijkenisse, the so-called Bukenberg! </seg>
<seg id="1515"> After nine years, the mountain value of 30 million euros has increased. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> It is part of a revitalization project that includes an underground garage, supermarket, post office and several adjacent houses and townhouses for a total of 50 apartments. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> In early November &quot;Book Mountain&quot; was awarded the second prize of the contest &quot;Best Library of the Netherlands in 2012.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1518"> The project is also involved in a national competition Dutch wooden structures in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> Thus, the faceless suburb, previously could not offer anything but post-modern pedestrian zone and surprisingly ugly town hall, white facades which suggest dairy, became richer by one modern piece of architecture. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> But most importantly - in Spijkenisse appeared first in the history of this small town public building cultural facilities. </seg>

<seg id="1523"> There is only one elevator that takes place in the center of the rock mass, because the real fans of architecture and prefer reading to explore this area on foot. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> Sash on all sides the room - light and easily foreseeable, the floors of brick and elegant street lamps accurately create a sense of urban public space. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban environment is recreated perfectly. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> Glance involuntarily looking for benches, dogs and playing football boys and girls. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And everywhere - books, books, books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;Usually, bookshelves line the facades, and in the middle is a large dark room, usually bleak and faceless&quot; - says Winnie Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We have put a classical configuration space on its head and pulled the zone read from the inside out. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The interior of the book skillfully used the mountains : in the center of the offices, online library, chess club, an environmental center and technical rooms. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Particularly pleasing black bookshelves, which are then finished walls, the parapets, the stair railings. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Their appearance, texture and smell unusual. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even the most experienced architects and civil engineers are at a loss, what is this unknown material. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;We wanted to work with recycled materials,&quot; - explains Joop Trauborst, project manager representing the community Spijkenisse, in accordance with the requirements of the standard. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> And once one agricultural enterprise in Friesland we met the right by-product of agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> For many years in the fields and greenhouses in the Netherlands as a lining under the roots of the artificial fiber material millimeter thickness. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> It&apos;s cheap and saves time. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Thin textiles used one season, then it can be thrown away. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> For a library, the painting - for the first time in such volumes - was compressed to four centimeters thick panel. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Under the action of heat and pressure of the so-called landbauplastik (KLP) is transformed into a dark, uniform, durable material, a bit like the smell of a new car and a bit of running shoes. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> At the top are 105 steps. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> He who overcomes path length of almost 500 meters, will be rewarded in a literary cafe is not only a fantastic view of the city, but also the Dutch croquettes and wood potted ficus. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> They care about the atmosphere in the first place about the proper humidity in the literary mountain. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> The cost of a new soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;It&apos;s hard to believe, but the building, despite the many glass surfaces is a model project in terms of ecology,&quot; - says Trouborst. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> For its heating and cooling uses the heat of the earth. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Although Book mountain stands in a glass case, even on clear days, the sun falls within a short time. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> Extensive farm of plywood, placed perpendicular to the glass facade, provide shade and take over much of the sun&apos;s rays. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> Indoor climate is very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The rest of protection is provided by a fully automatic roller blinds. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stephen Spermon referred to above skeptic of the IT industry, has already visited the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Lisette Verhayg was also present here. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> And as a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogard, who called Bukenberg &quot;the soul of Spijkenisse, which has long lacked.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1554"> Reason: a few weeks before the opening of each resident received an invitation to donate a book from its collection. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> These books were to occupy the empty space on the shelves is not yet fully staffed library - at that time it had 70,000 books. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The idea worked. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The shelves are made to the top. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> &quot;There is nothing worse than a half-empty library,&quot; - says architect Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot;I think that thanks to our invitation, now everyone in some way connected to this new home. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Everyone knows that his book is part of the building. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Even if it is just for decoration. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> Thus, MVRDV was able to solve the royal task, which is called in the jargon of identity building. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Spijkenisse wrote his literary history. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> And though they are very young and uneducated. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> It&apos;s just the starting point for the construction of identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Sabu: &quot;The Germans have to play a more important role&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the U.S. and Europe, in so doing, Berlin diplomatic balancing on the narrow track. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany first made it clear that she would vote against the Palestinian bid for observer status at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But then the Berlin abstained. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo : Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Who Germany needs to be cautious with regard to its special relationship with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But at the same time, I believe that the American position, it also does not support. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to show his independence - while not speaking too critical of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained in the vote on the introduction of a no -fly zone. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> As a result, NATO held this proposal. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Germany&apos;s hard to take a clear position on complex international issues? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, it is. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> The fact that it is in the process of converting its foreign policy, namely the proceeds of the policy, which is to say, the United States managed to actually German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Additionally situation is complicated by the fact that the Europeans have no agreed common policy. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> Thus, the Germans are again between the two fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> From them, it is expected that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to it. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I believe that as long as they only feel for the role, but are on the way to a &quot;more normal&quot; foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> Such a foreign policy which holds France or the UK. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What exactly is &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy from the German point of view? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It is the willingness to take a position of its own national interests, which does not depend on the position of the United States or European partners. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, the export and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> Germany&apos;s economic interests are largely different from those of other large states, and therefore Germany must defend its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> Did these economic interests in the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> First, Germany has the largest markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> Therefore, it is necessary to be careful not to offend the public and elites in the Arab world. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> In any case, it plays a role. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I would not give it too much importance, it is not entirely one-sided communication. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculation of the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Germany harmed if its relations with the United States abstaining when making important decisions, such as voting on Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States dominates the understanding of German positions. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> So I do not think it was such a dramatic change of heart, as in the Libyan issue. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps Germany will become even so some respect. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> After all, it indicates that it should be taken seriously as a player on the international scene and that its interests should be considered. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe, there are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> United States, by contrast, clearly supported the veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> Is there a difference of opinion between the U.S. and many European countries? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> Because of American domestic politics, such differences have always existed. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the Obama administration is at heart a sufficient understanding of the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But due to the local political situation the government, of course, can not openly take such a position. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that the essential difference of opinion is not so great as always is. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not enthusiastic about the politics Netanyahu. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Is it easy to combine their German ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the most important partner of the EU on the other? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I think that&apos;s what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Of course, the Germans would be somewhat easier if there was a single, consistent European policy, but now it is not. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> Therefore, they can not act as part of a broader approach and instead are forced to act, relying only on their own vision of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> That&apos;s what they do with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I think that in the future Germany will take a lead role in the development of a common European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> It is clear that, for Germany it is not easy, if only because of ties with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This topic has always been a hot potato. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I think it is clear to the Germans that they should play a more independent role. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> If Germany itself sees itself as an important international player - if she would take over the lead role really? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or leading role is still difficult given Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany still has not got used to it, it still is always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, there is still always difficult given to play a significant role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time when Germany takes on the important role that brings out the various anti-German feelings. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> The Germans do not just deal with it. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> Actually, this is an old problem : you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> From this standpoint, Germany is much worse situation than the USA. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It must take into account the various neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Thus, the influence of the U.S. in European politics permanently weakened, but at the moment the EU does not fill the void, then who is? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans will just have to play a more significant role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if you do not like, dislike or enhances unpleasant to you - that&apos;s life! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Szabo - the deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, DC, the institute where academics and political experts from Europe and North America jointly investigate problems of the transatlantic community. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> In addition, Sabo - a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he specializes in German politics, U.S. foreign policy and transatlantic relations. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> &quot;Protection of Trademark&quot; in China when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani - the world-famous Brand, Ralph Lauren - TOZ√â. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> No. What is Armani Polo? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> This is a brand officially registered in the name of China, which has nothing to do with the companies of the names which it is formed. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> Nevertheless, it will be protected as long as the owners of the original names do not sue. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> But even then, it is unclear whether they can defend their rights. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;Foreigners are increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,&quot; - says Thomas Pattloh, the lawyer of Taylor Wessing, specializing in violation of trademark rights in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> On my desk every week there is a new case of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> The simulator is enough to add a couple of letters to be eligible to register their trademarks. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> So it turns out Gucci Lu-Gucci, Prada, instead, you can register Prada-Kny. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> The same way legally copied German companies, such as sporting goods manufacturer Puma. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Pattloh opens the folder with the records department of trademark registration in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> September 14, 2010 there is a Chinese company registered trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name, which used the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> The fact that the Chinese - the world champions of copying and infringement of intellectual property rights is well known. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In large cities, there are multi-story department stores that sell almost exclusively forgery. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> However, things are not as Pattloha. On behalf of their clients, he is opposed to Chinese enterprises quite officially received from the department trademark the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese call it the &quot;ban minpay&quot; mark - passenger. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The word is synonymous with &quot;ban dakuan.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1649"> So called women who hunt for wealthy men. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> Chinese authorities did not recognize their guilt </seg>
<seg id="1651"> &quot;It is detrimental to business, it is necessary to fight&quot; - convinced Pattloh. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;The brand is eroded, a unique position is lost, the image suffers greatly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected areas in the millions, especially in the case of expensive products being copied. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to market research firm CLSA, China, with sales of EUR 15 billion a year is the third largest and fastest-growing market for luxury goods. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> However, to achieve removal of questionable entries in the register of trade marks is difficult, and it is expensive. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> The process can take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Pattloh talks about the cases in which the court dismissed the claims, as after a long time has protested the name became &quot;a reality of the market.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1658"> If the claimant is not lucky, he will have to pay even a plagiarist, as has damaged its trade mark in China, says Pattloh. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> Sometimes the law of the jungle reigns here. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> There is also the famous case of the graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009, Daimler lost the lawsuit against the manufacturer of construction machinery Sany, now that is not long before the company acquired a manufacturer of concrete pumps, Putzmeister. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use the logo, similar to the star of Mercedes. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> Geely bought Volvo company originally used the blue-and- white logo resembling a BMW; process was successful, Geely had to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> Manufacturer of fashion goods Lacoste lost imitators in China from Hong Kong and Singapore, among which the famous crocodile looked the other way. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> The Chinese authorities do not consider myself guilty. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> Trademark Office CTMO in Beijing confirmed that in 2010 due to lack of staff and equipment of the premises there were difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> But last year there was a &quot;return of emergency in the workflow to normal.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1668"> Thus, the number of untreated cases of objections has decreased by 22 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> It has been closed almost 57,000 such cases, 75 percent more than last year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> However 81.500 claims are still waiting in the production department. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> Fighting this is expensive </seg>
<seg id="1672"> Like so often in China, the numbers are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for the Protection of trademarks, nearly a third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> This record means that China is the tenth time in a row topped the list of new registrations in the world, according to the Office. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> In 2011 it was 1.8 billion yuan paid fees. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> If you simplify, it means that each record is an average of 1,280 yuan or 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> To challenge its worth many times more, as shown by the case of German family-owned company Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years of fighting against the Chinese concern plagiarist. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> The Germans managed to achieve what they illegal production of counterfeit automotive parts were eliminated. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> However, the simulator has secured the rights to the Chinese trademark of Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> It was his own omission, as the name in Germany are not protected, says Hanno Venttsler, chairman of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> And Registered Trademark Office rejected the claim CTMO Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> However, in both these instances Freudenberg won, but the other party continues to fight to this day. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> Need to be alert </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Now the issue is pending before the Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Venttsler hopes to bring it to a good end, and praised the professionalism of courts. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But he also said : &quot;The process is extremely expensive and takes up a lot of time, money and nerves.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> Internal costs can hardly be accounting, the company had to look through the archive, even acts of a century ago to lead evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago, to no avail Freudenberg suggested the opposite party &quot;big six-figure sum in euros&quot; for the settlement. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> &quot;It is clear to us how expensive it is,&quot; - says Venttsler. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The dangers of the Far East threaten to spill over even into Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> Namely, if there simulators will register for an unprotected trademarks. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for footwear and leather goods. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> Concern has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this failed to prevent the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;We need to be alert,&quot; - says Venttsler. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Both he and the lawyer Pattloh recommend German companies to be very careful with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough to rely on the international provisions on the protection of trademarks, most foreigners should be &quot;all that is in any way worth protecting, also recorded in China,&quot; - says Venttsler. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise it can not do much more than check. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> Indeed, if Freudenberg lose in the last act of the drama of his trade mark, it will have to pay the other party license fees for their own name, explains Venttsler. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Otherwise, we displace from the market in the contested segment. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> World AIDS Day : stamped his, to sing, to help </seg>

<seg id="1710"> At the rehearsal came fifty members of the choir from 23 to 69 years, from a specialist in human genetics to the janitor. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> &quot;Om&quot; Aubagne &quot; - not an easy thing, every voice choir has its text, in addition to a completely alien language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in some parts of Swaziland. </seg>

<seg id="1713"> According to an estimate Unaids, the United Nations program on AIDS, there are about 34 million HIV- infected people. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> 23.5 million of them live in southern Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> In Swaziland, home to 245,000 AIDS orphans. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> With more than 40 percent of the population are HIV-positive. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> For 180 AIDS orphans in the village Esitzheni union Voices for Africa has found patrons in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> 70 of them are in school, preparing for further study. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take patronage. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> It guarantees a child money for school uniforms and daily hot lunch at Gogo center. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> Imbongi a Zulu word meaning storyteller or claque. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> In this room do not speak fluently on the Bantu, but they can sing. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> For almost ten years the choir rehearses songs on this foreign language soft and at times even brings them back to where they first appeared : the South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> After all, at a distance of 8733 kilometers from the summer of Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Esitzheni, which depends on the votes of the German choir. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> Forty percent of the infected </seg>
<seg id="1726"> They live about 2000 people, some still in simple huts made of clay and straw, among the inhabitants of many children. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> More than 300 of them have lost their parents, who had died from the virus ICH. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> In Esitzheni reflected in miniature of the disease in Swaziland: the highest rates of HIV infection, the world&apos;s lowest life expectancy according to UNICEF. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> Circumcision in men, which is proven to reduce the risk of infection by half of the population is almost not accepted. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> More than forty percent of the population of Swaziland are carrying immunodeficiency virus, the death of the middle thirties - are not uncommon. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> Choir opened the village in a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before the participants Imbogni saw a lot of children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but simply all: food, clothing and education. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> No school education a person in a poor country does not have any sort of chance. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> At first it was a private undertaking individual members - for a few euros a year to send a child to school and give him the opportunity to once a day to get a hot meal. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> But a year later founded the association choir &quot;Voices for Africa&quot;, which has since almost professionally care for AIDS orphans in Esitzheni. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> Facts about infections, sexually transmitted </seg>
<seg id="1736"> What are the most important diseases, sexually transmitted infections? </seg>
<seg id="1737"> By bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea (gonorrhea). </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Frequent viral STIs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes and hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> Pubic lice and scabies are parasitic STIs. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> What are the primary effects of the band? </seg>
<seg id="1741"> Syphilis and gonorrhea are found mainly in men who have sex with men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The Robert Koch Institute comes from the fact that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis reported in Germany, the transmission is through sexual contact between men. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> In heterosexual adults frequently occurring diseases, sexually transmitted chlamydial infections are trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea and the human papilloma virus. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults have relatively low - but about 20 percent of new HIV infections account for this group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Chlamydial infections among young people are significantly more likely than other groups. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> According to European data, three quarters of all infections affect young people 15 to 25 years. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> Our youth are also common human papilloma virus. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> How does the number of cases of infection? </seg>
<seg id="1749"> Not all diseases, sexually transmitted diseases, subject to mandatory registration. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> The number of new HIV infections in 2007, is reduced. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> This is about one-tenth less than in the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> What symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease? </seg>
<seg id="1755"> With infectious diseases can occur in the genital ulcers, complaints during urination, discharge, pain in the abdomen, as well as vesicles or seal. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> However, often they are not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain undetected. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How can I protect myself? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide absolute protection. </seg>

<seg id="1772"> &quot;AIDS - is an absolute taboo&quot; - says Annette Lennartts - &quot;because it is connected with sexuality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1773"> Quite unusual for a country in which the king officially has 14 wives. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> Last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excess. </seg>

<seg id="1787"> Probe &quot;Messenger&quot; has found evidence that the planet Mercury is the ice. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> Ice cover may have a thickness of 20 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> U.S. space agency NASA has proven the presence of ice on the planet Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Although it is closer to the Sun, there is also a frozen water, as is evident from the three studies published Thursday in a special journal Science. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> Probe &quot;Messenger&quot; has found evidence that the permanently shadowed region of the planet is covered with ice. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> Its thickness should be at least 30 centimeters, and perhaps even up to 20 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> Presumably, the water comes from a comet or perhaps an asteroid colliding with Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> No one connects the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said the supervisor of the probe Sean Solomon. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> However, these findings could help explain how water and other building blocks of life were in other places the solar system. </seg>

<seg id="1835"> Our views of the universe : the most important telescopes </seg>
<seg id="1836"> Probably, the telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgeem - even before Galileo Galilei one year later began to observe the stars. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Since then, the mirror optical telescopes got bigger - and available to their view of the space deeper. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, the telescope &quot;Hale&quot; in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> Mirror, as shown here, has a diameter of five meters. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> In Arizona, United States, is set to &quot;Large Binocular Telescope.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1841"> It allows you to look into space by means of two mirrors, each 8.4 meters in diameter. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> &quot;Gran Canarias Telescopes&quot; has a huge interior - the diameter of the mirror alone is 10.4 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> Mirror &quot;Great South African telescope&quot; in South Africa is segmented - for the sake of reducing the cost. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> Nevertheless it reaches a diameter of approximately eleven meters. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> The lack of low-cost designs: telescope rigidly attached to a vertical angle - it limits his mobility. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> Telescope &quot;Hobby- Eberly&quot; in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> Its feature : high light gathering ability. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> It reaches - in spite of the relatively small diameter of the mirror - the world&apos;s largest telescopes parameters. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> Using a radio telescope at Arecibo (Puerto Rico), the researchers listened to extraterrestrial signals in space. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1851"> By participating in the project &quot;Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence&quot; (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing their computing power. </seg>

<seg id="1855"> In the Chilean Observatory ESO also plan to install a European &quot;Very Large Telescope&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> Its main mirror must be spread on as much as 42 meters - and is made up of nearly 1,000 mirror elements. </seg>

<seg id="1872"> However, reliable data on this, as the &quot;Messenger&quot; is rotated closer to the north pole of the planet. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> Radar measurements over the decades have pointed to the fact that there is ice on Mercury. </seg>

<seg id="1883"> Minibus with rumblings rolls along a winding road, past rolling hills overgrown with thick forests, gushing rivers and simple peasant houses. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> Everything is so green and bright that you would think that you are in the Black Forest. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> But it is the most southern edge of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is just a few kilometers from here. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> Talysh live here - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, about which little is known, except that they had a say in Farsi and azerbayzhdanskom and are long-lived. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> The final point is Lerik. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> Small town brags too heavy-handed Soviet-era architecture, which is not in harmony with the picturesque mountain landscape. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> Tourists from Europe almost never come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too tedious. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> At 323 kilometers away eight hours because the road has only one lane. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> The legendary wealth, which the country owes oil of the Caspian Sea, here, in the province until it got. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> But Pilate Fatullayev (48) is convinced that in Lerik have something to interest tourists. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> &quot;In May, Baku became famous Festival Song Contest - and next year we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world&quot; - says Fatullayev. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> It - Director of the Museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Here documented biography about eight dozen Talysh of these places, which are more than 100 years. Fatullayev points to black-and- white photo. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> This is my grandfather, he is 120 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> At the age of 136 years, he fathered another child </seg>
<seg id="1898"> But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Shirali Myuslyumov, who allegedly turned 168 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> Birth, however, do not. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> And given the fact that the oldest person whose age is confirmed by documents, turned 122 years old, the age of Myuslyumova seems extremely doubtful. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> &quot;He was born in the area in 1805, died in 1973,&quot; - explains Fatullayev. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, aged 136 years, he allegedly had a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> So we added a shepherd Myuslyumov couple of decades to my age? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> After all, even Rembrandt Scholz, researcher age of the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard of centenarians in Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> &quot;It&apos;s amazing a lot of older people can be found in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,&quot; - says Scholz, &quot;also lives in Sardinia is extremely a lot of very old people.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1906"> However, due to the lack of scientific proof of age document is not possible, because there was no civil status registers. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> Every day, a glass of melted butter </seg>
<seg id="1908"> Nevertheless, there is the fact that people in the area Lerika strikingly often reach the biblical age. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> Is now home to 20 people older than 100 years. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> Why here in the south, as many centenarians? </seg>
<seg id="1911"> Azerbaijani Farid Mugimzade guide explains the special genes Talysh. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> Fatullayev director of the museum, on the contrary, believes that the case for food. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> Talishs fond of meat, bread, and most dairy products, many of them drink a glass of melted butter every day. But it is unlikely such a high-calorie diet can be healthy with a nutritional point of view. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or is it the primitive way of life that keeps young people? In Chengemirane, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzoeva. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> In 97 years, it is still relatively young for these latitudes. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> Mirzaeva, which claims that it has 143 child lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> She sits on the floor with a barrel of oil that rolls back and forth without getting tired. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> Here are living under the same roof, eight people, including one of his sons and a daughter Mizraeva who have long been their grandchildren. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> Also nearby are jumping two kids. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> The kitchen can prepare tea, which is served in a typical pot-bellied jars Armudu. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> We Mizraeva perfectly smooth and strong white teeth, a head scarf she hides the long dark -blond braids that her son proudly reveals to us. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> I always wash my hair with milk, so they never get lost and saved color. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;And I never used the shampoo,&quot; - says Mirzaeva. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> Monthly pension is enough for life </seg>
<seg id="1925"> She always ate only what is grown in your own backyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> For all my life I have never shopped at the store. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Then she talks about her husband, who served in the military. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> The hardest part was after the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> But it became better when the &quot;beloved father&quot; Heydar Aliyev took the helm. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> Propaganda is not often heard in the speech of an old woman. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled as a dictator in Azerbaijan virtually no limits. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> He was in power until 2003, then took over the reins of his son Ilham. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> Nevertheless, among the old Azerbaijani no poverty. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> 230 manat (approximately equal to the same amount of euros) Mirzaeva receives monthly from pensions to local conditions is the amount for which you can live well. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> And, perhaps, for a long time, too, grew up the son of Mizraeva right: &quot;Old men in our culture are in deep respect.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1936"> They live in a big family, loved, surrounded by care and happy. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> What is not a reason to stay alive as long as possible </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The word &quot;human right&quot; is not in the Constitution </seg>
<seg id="1939"> The revolution has returned to Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> The rival demonstrations in Cairo indicate a deep split in the country. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> Future constitution based on Sharia, has met fierce resistance. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> Egyptian president did not skimp on the pathos. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> We need to create a transition. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> &quot;And its success is my responsibility to the people and to God,&quot; - he said on state television. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> His speech was addressed to all people, but especially to the Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> After all, they are still hopelessly fragmented opposition in a confused, afraid. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> The fear of a religious state on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful &quot;Muslim Brotherhood.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1948"> Mohammed Mursi, almost apologetically said that he temporarily cut the competence of the Constitutional Court and extended its jurisdiction &quot;to save the revolution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1949"> But what really wants to save the 61 -year-old engineer, has a doctorate in American University of Southern California, it is not clear the Egyptians and the world. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> Will the judiciary lacks power? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> In fact, Article 234 managed to push through the night 15 -hour grind on Islamist constitutional assembly of 100 members, and it is partly a concern. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> As in previous constitutions, the draft states that legal proceedings based on &quot;the principles of Islamic law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1953"> But what does &quot;principles&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> It was and still is a matter of interpretation, and it is possible to fear that Islamists will use vague wording and arising in connection with the legal clearance for the stricter interpretation of Sharia law. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> At the very least, this suggests a newly introduced article: in all matters relating to Shariah, should be involved to the Board of the University of Al - Ashar, the most important Islamic institution in the country, is widely respected throughout the Sunni Islam. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> It should not, but it could mean that the clergy oversees legislation that de facto would be a consequence of the restriction of the judiciary. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> The draft constitution is the subject of much interpretation </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Another problem that should continue jurisdiction of civilians to military courts. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> These courts during Mubarak&apos;s government were to suppress the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> After the overthrow of a dictator in military custody were up to 11,000 civilians. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> Also, as stated in the project, the state must protect the &quot;true essence of Egyptian family&quot; and &quot;to maintain its morals and values .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1962"> Legally it is worded so vaguely that government agencies through this article will be able to control even the content of films and literature. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Plaintext, this means neither more nor less than censorship. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> In general, no article establishes the equality of men and straight women. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> But the other prohibits insulting and defaming the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> But that is an insult and how it should be punished, remains unclear. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Also questionable is the wording that prohibited &quot;an insult to the people.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1968"> Is it enough to be caricatures of the president or the jokes about lawyer? </seg>
<seg id="1969"> The question of interpretation, like so much of the project, which offers a signature Mursi and which, in his words, &quot;very soon&quot; will be presented to the Egyptians to a referendum. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> &quot;The revolution has returned&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1971"> For weeks, the opposition formed against Islamist supremacy. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual unanimity Friday night in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it can enter into force. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> &quot;The revolution is back and we will win,&quot; - said Hamdin Sabbah, who took third place in the presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Minister Mohammed el -Baradei said that the draft constitution be &quot;on the ash heap of history.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1975"> Via Short news Twitter he accused supporters of Mursi in the desire to lead a &quot;coup against democracy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1976"> &quot;If he will announce a referendum, we will go to his palace, and his tabernacle,&quot; - said the opposition leader Yasser Said. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> &quot;We&apos;re not tired, the blood of our brothers have not yet avenged&quot; - quoted the Egyptian media opposition leader Khaled Ali. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> Many judges also said they did not want to observe the referendum, which would make it invalid. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> &quot;Koran - our konstituci—è&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1980"> Well-organized &quot;Muslim Brotherhood&quot;, in turn, called for a demonstration opposite, but, as a precaution, not in Tahrir Square, and after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of Cairo University. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> It was attended by a large number of women under the covers and supporters Salafis, who shouted : &quot;The people demand the application of God&apos;s law.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1984"> Followers of the Mursi, quite obviously, did not want to take that risk. </seg>

<seg id="2001"> Norwegian rakfisk : the most foul- smelling fish in the world? </seg>
<seg id="2002"> In the five million population in Norway is one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but throughout the world. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> Perhaps the secret of the success of this country is somehow connected with the local predilection for one very smelly fish dish? </seg>
<seg id="2004"> Take a few pieces of overripe cheese. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> Put them in a pile of dirty and sweaty sportswear. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> Leave them there for a week. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> You will smell the smell otshibayuschy rakfiska - one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> I &apos;m in a little town called Fagernes, three hours drive from Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> Around the snow-covered scenic views. It&apos;s very beautiful, but the air is diffused indestructible characteristic odor. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> Rakfisk - it&apos;s trout, sprinkle with salt and fermented in water up to a year, depending on what exactly you need to get ducky. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> As the dusk and the cold, the crowd of Norwegians are going to a festival in Fagernes dedicated to this very, shall we say, a spectacular dish. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> &quot;It is eaten raw and washed down with a glass of aquavit, local caraway vodka&quot; - explains H√•vard Halvarsen, a local fireman by profession and in combination &quot;rakfiskovy general&quot;, who runs the festival. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> All around us people eat fish cut into small cubes and wash down with her considerable portions of alcohol. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> &quot;Some people prefer aquavit than rakfisk&quot; - says Havard. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> This drink is able to kill the smell. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> I try a couple of pieces. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> If we manage to carry the piece under his nose, then it&apos;s not so bad - not unlike portions of sushi, you drove a long time with him on the bus. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> Rakfisk - a Norwegian product from completely different times, the times of poverty, when, before the advent of refrigeration, fish fall soaked in sealed barrels of salt water. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> Then, in the dead of winter, when the fish are well and thoroughly fermented, it recovered and, by reducing the perception of alcohol consumed as food. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> More on the memory of the previous generation of the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and to emigrate, mainly in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants who are here involve jobs, higher wages and a developed system of social security. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> Residents of Sweden (longtime rival, and not so long ago and far more prosperous neighbor) massively come here to work. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> Rakfisk perceived as a significant symbol, of course, if somewhat fetid last element Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> This is one of the most expensive local dishes. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> On the other hand, everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you ¬£ 9 ($ 14). </seg>
<seg id="2026"> Norway is rarely seen in world news, and most of the inhabitants of the country it seems to be satisfied. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Breivik, the racist and right-wing extremist, last year shot and killed 77 men, women and children. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> Without mentioning his name, called the attack &quot;happened on July 22.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2029"> Norwegians are very hard to believe that in their peace-loving country, one of their fellow citizens should be capable of such atrocities and murders. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> At the heart of today&apos;s well-being is the growth of Norway (early seventies), one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> &quot;However, the oil - not the only reason for our prosperity,&quot; - says Anna, our waitress that carry trays of seasoned rakfiskom, a woman with long blonde hair and striking blue eyes, the embodiment of the Nordic welfare. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> We are a people - as you call it - reasonable. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> Like most Norwegians, she is fluent in English. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> We do not like to exhibit at the show, we do not boastful. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Norway is drawn very carefully with its oil - most of the oil and gas revenues are invested in a special fund set up for the benefit of future generations. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> In the years before the global financial crisis, when all littered with money, which they did not have, Norway frugally counted all costs. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> &quot;As long as you can go skiing in winter and hiking in summer, it is sufficient for happiness,&quot; - says Anna. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> &quot;And there rakfisk&quot; - she adds with a carefree laugh. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> I &apos;m standing in the snow waiting in line for some food - rakfiska had enough. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> Here&apos;s a burger with elk meat - that&apos;s exactly exotic, tasty juicy meat. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> But in the evening we will see even more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> In my hotel have a special dinner celebrating rakfisk, during which visitors vote determine the best or perhaps the most flavorful fish. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> There is a live television broadcast in which show host in a bow tie, surrounded by plates of rakfiskom. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> It&apos;s like the song contest &quot;Eurovision&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> &quot;So, Tor- Jurgen, what grade you set for the best fish there for themselves in the mountains?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2046"> &quot;Yes, Havard, vote our assessment&quot;.... </seg>
<seg id="2047"> Everyone laughs and applauds. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> Someone falls from a chair may exhausting aquavit. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> Or maybe just inhaling the smell of the fish. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> President of Mexico, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto have a difficult career start. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> While the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto prepares to take office, the BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to look at the challenges that it faces and to mixed expectations of the population of his country. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> Traffic in Mexico City is now in a particularly poor condition. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> This city is overloaded with traffic and at the best time, and Monday were erected steel fences, cut several main highways to the capital and caused chaos on the roads. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> However, this was not done in order to prevent people to get to work from the suburbs, and to prevent the protesters go to the parliament building. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> On Sunday, the new head of Mexico Enrique Pe√±a Nieto put on the presidential sash and take the reins of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> In front of him is not an easy task. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Mexico has achieved good economic performance during the administration of Felipe Calderon, who now puts his powers, but the country is mired in a war on drugs, which in six years has claimed about 60,000 lives. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> &quot;My government says the Mexican people about their willingness to fight violence&quot; - said earlier this week, Mr. Pe√±a Nieto U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White House. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> I&apos;m going to offer a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Until such statements next to the U.S. president &apos;s political career, Mr. Pe√±a Nieto has developed as governor of his home state of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> In his country, in a densely populated and vast state surrounding the capital city, the views of the new leadership was divided. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> The straight man </seg>
<seg id="2063"> In the idyllic village of Valle de Bravo, for example, think about it fondly. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Residents credit him with the revival of tourism, the development of resort areas and infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> Before the city can be reached by one of the new highway, built ith Pe√±a Nieto, who are very different from the roads with potholes and pits that were previously on the site. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Signs with his name hanging on the modern building of the sports center and on the spectacular interactive museum dedicated to climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;We connect with it hope for a real and serious changes,&quot; - says his friend and political ally of Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, headed by State Rep. Pe√±a Nieto of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). </seg>
<seg id="2068"> We expect real and radical changes that are so desperately needed in our country, especially in the field of security and economic development. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> After &apos;81 continuous stay in power the party PRI was ousted in 2000, Vicente Fox. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years of absence from the presidential palace Los Pinos party has high hopes for Enrique Pe√±a Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> In addition, he refutes allegations of emptiness, which the opposition has put forward a new president. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> It is very straightforward and very dedicated to the cause of realization of his vision of the future of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> This is an excellent statesman, and, above all, a man who knows how to listen. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> But in another part of the state, many people have a different view of the former governor. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> The municipality of Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Nes, is a most striking contrast to the cobblestone streets of Valle de Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Hidden under the highway overpasses, in many ways, it is a suburb of Mexico City itself. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And the problems in the municipality are too harsh nature of this metropolis. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Earlier this year, for the suppression of gang selling drugs in these areas have been brought troops, but violence against women is particularly acute here. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> In a vacant lot near a vast landfill in the last two years, they found several dozen dead bodies of women. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> More than a thousand women have been killed in Mexico State during the Governorship of Mr. Pe√±a Nieto - is much higher than a similar figure in the became notorious violent city of Ciudad Juarez, whose name has become a household name when it comes to murder innocent women. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> According to opponents of Mr. Pe√±a Nieto about it, at best, it can be said that during his tenure as governor, he was unable to cope with the problem of femicide. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> In the worst case, however, his administration is accused of completely ignoring this problem. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> A resident of the concrete house, like most houses in a dilapidated neighborhood, Irenaeus Buendia barely holding back tears, showing me pictures of his deceased daughter, Mariana Luna. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> According to the official version of Marian in 2010 committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> However, her family believes that she was killed by her live-in boyfriend. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> &quot;When I got to her house, it seemed that her body was washed before it&quot; - says Ms. Buendia. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> There were signs that she was beaten, and the body is numbed. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> Mother Mariana retells the story, and a portrait of her daughter looks at us from the wall where it hangs next to the crucifix, which is inscribed on one word : fairness. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> It is in this, according to them, was denied to this family. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> &quot; Officials of the State treated me like an old gossip, unhappy offending tranquility. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> They want people to just take for granted all that they say, and kept quiet. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> But it is wrong, you can not, especially when there are so many irregularities and deficiencies, &quot;- she said. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> Donning the presidential sash on Saturday, President Pe√±a Nieto with her take on the difficult responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have affected crime of violence, and the new president promised to solve this problem a priority during his presidency. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> &quot;I hope that it will be the same president as he was governor,&quot; - says Olvera, a congressman from Valle de Bravo from the party PRI. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> Yet this is what is most feared families of the victims in Ciudad Nesa. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Bradley Manning did not complain of mistreatment, said the prosecution. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning of the poor conditions of detention. </seg>
<seg id="2099"> At the hearing, special attention was paid to stay Manning in military prison in Quantico, Virginia. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> The defense demands to close the case on the grounds that the conditions of Manning&apos;s been brutal. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> U.S. Army private accused of stealing thousands of classified documents. </seg>
<seg id="2102"> On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, did not get many opportunities to make a complaint about the treatment, which, according to him, he had to move while in military custody. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> During cross-examination of the pre-trial hearing at Fort Meade, Maryland, a military prosecutor, Major Eshden Fein said Manning&apos;s record of weekly visits by representatives of the prison for the first nine months of his detention in Quantico, Va., contain no complaints about the treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> The cross-examination in the examination of the application protection to dismiss Manning on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were harsh and of themselves were sufficient punishment, was held the next day after Manning said that while in custody, he had intended to commit suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> Military Analyst intelligence, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> These materials were subsequently published on the website of WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> Resource WikiLeaks has not confirmed that the source of the information was just Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> During a hearing on Friday, Attorney Fein along with Manning looked at the reports that were filled after visits Manning administration officials during his stay in prison, Quantico, where he was subject to the strict prison regime from July 2010 to April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> During visits to prison officials asking Manning questions and recorded his answers. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> When the prosecutor asked Fein on Friday on reports, Manning acknowledged that evaluates treatment on the part of the prison as &quot;excellent&quot;, and the general terms and conditions as &quot;very professionally organized.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2111"> The above statements do not include complaints about the treatment, despite the fact that Manning was asked directly about the conditions of his detention, says Fein. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> Manning said he has expressed concern over these oral problems and that his administration officials visited discussed with him the problems and said that they will be engaged, but did not record it in writing. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> &quot;They did&quot; no problem &quot;(after discussing my complaints), but that does not mean that I did not raise this issue in an interview,&quot; - says Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> The military judge, Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain of ill-treatment of them in January 2011 during a meeting of the commission that examined suicidal ideation, which he expressed in writing a few months before. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> Manning said that during that meeting, he wanted to ensure that he was cleared mode &quot;injury prevention&quot; and softened the conditions of detention. </seg>
<seg id="2116"> Representatives of the military leadership explained that the limited regime of detention - at a lower level than the supervisory regime to prevent suicide - was introduced to protect the prisoner, as well as for the safety of others. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> &quot;I wanted to know the administration, that I was all right, so they canceled the mode of injury prevention... to the level of my life has improved, from my point of view,&quot; - said Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> On Thursday, Manning testified about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before transferred to the prison at the naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> He said that suicidal thoughts appeared in his Kuwait, and that one day he lost consciousness due to intense heat. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> He explained that psychologically very hard when you do not give to know how to solve your fate, and what is happening in the outside world. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> &quot; My world has shrunk to the base Camp Arifzhan, to the size of my prison - Manning said Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> - I thought I was going to die in this cage. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2123"> While at Quantico, Manning, according to him, spent most of his time in a small cell - at least 21 hours, and sometimes even more than 23 hours a day - all alone. </seg>
<seg id="2124"> Manning said that he was allowed to leave only a mattress, a blanket, slippers, a few items of clothing and goggles. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> He says he tried to move, as the sleep or even lie down during the day forbade the rules. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> According to Manning, while sleeping in his eyes constantly beat the light coming from outside the chamber. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> If the guards did not see his face when he rolled over in bed at night, then, according to him, woke him and forced to turn over on his back. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> Manning&apos;s lawyer has filed a formal objection to the unlawful treatment of Manning in January 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> In addition, the judge on Friday questioned Manning about a statement he made during his testimony on Thursday that after one night he was forced to sleep naked in his cell at Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates on the morning test. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> Manning said he had not been able to cover up with a blanket during checkout. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> Responding to questions from the judge on Friday, Manning said he understood from the order of the guard, that should throw blanket, which could hide behind, but admitted that no one explicitly ordered him to throw it. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> On Thursday, Manning said that the previous night he was forced to sleep naked because it attempts to show the officer that he is not a danger to himself. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> Manning said that the officer said that he could use the panty elastic or slippers to hurt himself, but he did not. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> That night, according to Manning, his underwear, flip-flops and sunglasses were taken from the camera. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> His lawyers are hoping that the judge, at least, will take into account the fact that he had to endure while in custody, and will significantly reduce the term of imprisonment, if Manning is convicted by a military court, which is to begin consideration of his case at the beginning of next year. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> Defence said it plans to offer Manning to plead guilty for lesser crimes, while others dispute the charges as excessive. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> The resumption of the hearing scheduled for this weekend, it is expected that the prosecution will insist that the conditions of detention were justified. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> The Pentagon claims that Manning was detained in Quantico, in accordance with the rules governing the content of those arrested with maximum security. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> Among the charges Manning, listed as aiding the enemy, the illegal promotion of disclosure of data on the Internet, the transmission of information relating to the national defense, and the kidnapping of state property or documents. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> If he is convicted on all counts of the indictment, he could face life in prison. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> My crisis of national self-determination - the story of Mexican Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to realize. </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind people of the country about difficult times. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Ruben Navarrete believes that American-born Mexicans are torn between two cultures. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> During a recent trip to Mexico City, I walked down the hall for arriving, close to the border control zone and froze. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Signs point to two queues, one for Mexicanos (Mexican), the second for Extranjeros (foreigners). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I have a few seconds stood before them, not knowing where to go. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I grew up in central California, and I had not been called Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> It&apos;s just a code name, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends from New York, consider themselves Italians. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Later, I stopped at the complex design &quot;Mexican American.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But here I was in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> Here, the birthplace of my grandfather, there was no need for conventional names or complex designs. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was just an American. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But my vocabulary is poorer than that of native speakers, and I can not get rid of the American accent. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> Because I got my American passport and was in the queue for Extranjeros. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I remembered this story a few days ago, when the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> The agenda for meetings of the presidents of customary these countries issues : immigration, drugs and trafficking. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> The President Pe√±a Nieto was eager to talk about the rise of the Mexican economy that Mexicans now, might as well be able to remain in Mexico, rather than move to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He wants to sign a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and to create a North American trading bloc like the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> In addition, the president of Pena Nieto promised to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals were heard. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> For Mexico, the relationship with the United States - a heavy and full of old grudges question. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans have never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and the barrel of rifles forced their leaders to give up half of its territory. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But Mexicans are thinking for centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of the events in all. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> Therefore it is necessary only to any statesman bad break though the word of criticism toward Mexico, in the press and among the elite of Mexican society immediately heard complaints that the Americans encroaching on the sovereignty of its neighbors. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the descendants of Montezuma was filled with militancy. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> The most difficult are the relations of Mexico with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican descent living in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Want to talk about the wrongs? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> Enough of them. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who are in this country for themselves of the opportunity, and those for whom there is no such possibility. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio are so many people of Mexican origin for one reason : at some point in their family history anyone - father or grandfather - was not able to fulfill themselves in Mexico and was forced to go to the north. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> Most of these were Mexicans specific type - dark-skinned, educated, from poor peasant families. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are their descendants, and we remember it. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> In Mexico, they see it differently. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> Today our lives - is the embodiment of the American dream, we went to good schools and get a good job, but we do not forget that even this dream - the American, not Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our national self-determination is confused and unclear, but we know what country to consider their own. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> United States of America. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> In addition, we know that the majority of the Mexican elite and the ruling class do not like us. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> We respond to them in kind. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> They see us as a reminder of the humiliating defeats, and treat us like second-class citizens, how to fake Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> We speak a little Spanish, and our relationship with Mexico is not strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> Our very existence is due to their failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> We would not be right now for a silk curtain, finding a comfortable life in the United States, but lost the spiritual connection. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the U.S. as a child, and it reminds me of the fact that between these Mexicans and Americans of Mexican descent there was some friction - Mexicans are clearly aware of their national identity, and Mexican Americans is insulting. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> She is a U.S. citizen and believes that it belongs to both countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> At the same time, many of my fellow Americans of Mexican descent do not feel accessory to any of them. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but love and Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> Getting the best of both worlds, you will inevitably lose the roots. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico, we are Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> In the U.S., we are called Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> Now, as I found out during my trip, as if our relationship already confusing enough, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the Diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want to Mexican Americans have worked a kind of ambassadors of Mexico and represented her interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We could tell his fellow Americans about what a beautiful country and a great visit it, and could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Yeah, of course. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> It will not work. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Too many injuries in the past. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And given the gap between rich and poor, rampant corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not consider this country so much lovely. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> Sorry, but to deal with this yourself, amigos. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> And rightfully so. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If the majority of Mexicans still can not forgive the United States the way they did with Mexico a half -century ago, they would have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans are still mad for the way recently in Mexico have done with their relatives. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> That along. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps we have more in common than I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> The old battle on a new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas&apos;s may be a fragile foundation for the future of the world </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Is a long-term peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Another round of bloodshed pushes the conclusion of the futility of such hopes. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Sounds that have become habitual, mindless debate about who started it, many buildings reduced to rubble, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis, for the first time during the conflict, issued from Gaza rockets landed in the vicinity Israel&apos;s capital Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> However, despite the fact that the Israelis and Palestinians are hopelessly mired in its age-old conflict in the Middle East came to change. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> To this can be treated differently, but the events of the &quot;Arab Spring&quot; in the breakaway storm whirled many well-established reality, with the Israelis and the Palestinians could not stay away from the vortex that shook the region. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps as a result, their struggle to become even more bloody than before. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> However, there are reasons that give hope for a way out of this deadly stalemate. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> The war without winners </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance, the current situation does not give grounds for optimism. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if the cease-fire agreement which was signed on November 21, will run that occurred this week only strengthened the position of the collision security officials from both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas took power in Gaza in 2007, said on the fact that they forced Israel to withdraw, despite the losses incurred by them. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Despite the fact that some of the leaders of the group were killed and 1.7 million people are locked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of the world, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> In fact, Hamas is increasing its popularity in the West Bank - another Palestinian -controlled territory is now more moderate Fatah. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Moreover, the leaders of Hamas may well come to the conclusion that time is on their side. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> With the growing influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world in Hamas are new influential and wealthy friends. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Reviving a regional leader in Turkey, which was once Israel&apos;s closest ally among Muslim countries, made with the support of Hamas, and its example was followed by Qatar, one of the richest and fastest growing states in the Persian Gulf. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> The triumphant Hamas supporters say the creation of an Islamic crescent around Israel - from Lebanon to the north, which rules the militant group Hezbollah, to Syria, where more and more about proislamistskie rebels overthrow Bashar al- Assad&apos;s power, and then to Jordan, where the king&apos;s power threaten allies Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> The most significant change in the balance of forces in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country, Egypt, where the President Mohammed Mursi strengthened the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood movement. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator who does not pay special attention to supporting Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> The Muslim Brotherhood, in contrast, is an organization in many ways similar to Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomatic arrangements of Hamas could become a significant player, whose voice can not be silenced even by Israel and America. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> At the same time, proponents of the &quot;hard&quot; line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In a military sense, Hamas was defeated. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The Israeli missile defense system &quot;Iron Dome&quot; has justified the cost of creating and successfully destroyed many of the rockets launched by Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> Israeli citizens can sleep easy, at least for a while. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> As for diplomacy, the United States remained true to its unwavering position, many European countries are also blamed for starting the latest round of violence on Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, particularly in the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Despite the fact that since 2004 about 30 Israelis were killed by rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, Israel was able to minimize the problem of suicide, in part through the wall that goes to the West Bank of the Jordan River - a large part of the unrecognized Palestinian state - and protects the Jewish settlements, which continue to grow despite the illegality of such actions from the point of view of international law. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party - in preparation for the planned January 22 elections - has teamed up with an even more aggressive-minded conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, is very convenient. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> What is the point to indulge the Palestinians and give them their own state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If you give in their hands all the power in the West Bank, if they do not start to run out rockets at Israel, as do their counterparts in the Gaza Strip? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> It is better to keep them behind a wall and hard to suppress any attempts to lift the head. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps the proponents of the &quot;hard&quot; line will win, but their calculations can be refuted by the Arab Spring. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Given that the Islamists come to power in Egypt and other countries, do not have the warmest feelings towards Israel, their priority will be domestic problems. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> Part of Israel &apos;s defense budget is greater than that of all its Arab neighbors combined. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> The outbreak of war with the regional superpower is unlikely to help the governments of the Arab countries to strengthen their own economies. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> Pragmatism is the President of Egypt, Mursi, which together with Barack Obama worked on a cease-fire is a good sign and could mark the beginning of a change. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> Israel, no less, has to take into account the long-term consequences of their policies. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> With the onset of democratic change in the Arab world, the deprivation of the right of Palestinians to self-determination is a time bomb that will explode sooner or later the Israeli-occupied territories, like the bus blown up in Tel Aviv this week. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> The repression has undermined the foundations of the democratic order in a Jewish state, and the demographic aspect - the growth of the Arab population - only exacerbates these problems. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> During the bloody operations that are carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress Hamas, have to pay the growing discontent of the international community. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need an external pulse </seg>
<seg id="2249"> It remains the only solution to which constantly urge sensible representatives from both sides, and most of the rest of the world and our paper : the formation of the two states and territories concessions by Israel in exchange for security. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> There is a hope, not too impressive in the short term - the hope that the ceasefire would allow other countries to better influence the parties to the conflict. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt, which for a long time it is time to make a decision to cut off supplies of weapons to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar have, as ever, advantageous position to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state since 1967 and taking into account the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile Hamas and Fatah. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> It would do more to create a Palestinian state than the upcoming vote in the UN, which could result in the recognition of a virtual state of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> His role is to sit down Israel to the negotiating table must play and President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first term, he has not presented his own peace plan. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> After returning to the White House, he continues to show reluctance to be connected to the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> This is a catastrophic short-sighted attitude. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The United States have a vital interest in the stability of the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> In Australia, the law came into force on standardized packaging for cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Health warnings and images of diseased body parts contrast with the dull green boxes that are the same for all brands of cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The first in the world practice the same type of Australian law on packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing the logo and color design of various brands of the same box of dull olive green with eerie images of diseased body parts and images of children whose health is undermined by their parents smoking. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> In addition to the different images and labels warning of the dangers of smoking, the only difference between the packs, introduced on a mandatory basis this Saturday - brand names, which are printed the same small print. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> This is the harshest conditions in the world to design packages of tobacco products. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The Federal Government of Australia states that the purpose of this measure - to keep young people from smoking, depriving the habit of the fashion status. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> The basis of this decision based on the results of studies showing that people do not start smoking before 26 years, in 99 cases out of 100 never become smokers. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;It is clear that even in a very young age, children understand the meaning of that tobacco companies are trying to convey by means of packaging,&quot; - says Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies showing that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated in children with the idea of a princess. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Australia is one of the countries with the lowest proportion of smokers in the world, so that the changes are not particularly affect the profits of multinational corporations, but the possibility of adopting similar measures are already considering other countries. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of the law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market, which will be sold cheap and affordable cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;This law will lead to serious consequences other than those conceived by the initiators,&quot; - says Scott McIntyre, a spokesman for British American Tobacco in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Manufacturers of fake products from China and Indonesia will supply much more of these items for sale on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> For some, however, new laws have contributed to the growth of the business. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra Ha from a small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd argues that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone cases that hide the unpleasant pictures on the packaging has grown rapidly (from scratch) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, the British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a case in the high Court of Australia, where they tried to challenge the law. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> According to Sandra Ha, Zico company has already sold about six thousand products wholesale trade and expects the new party. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> For us, it&apos;s good business. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> Potential hindrance to the effectiveness of such measures is, in the opinion of experts, the popularity of social networks is that part of the population to which these measures are directed. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> After the adoption of several laws in Australia, who made an illegal television advertising of cigarettes and their support of sporting events, as well as prohibiting cigarette sellers put in a prominent place, tobacco advertising has moved to the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> The Australian Government has banned local companies and websites to advertise on the network, but it can not limit this foreign sites. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;If you trade in tobacco products, and you were left with this little loophole, the idea is to promote your product online you will find extremely attractive,&quot; - says Becky Freeman, exploring issues of public health at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Freeman notes the increase in the number of reviews of trademarks, written on behalf of the supposedly normal users in social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> The question arises - whether it was the work of an ordinary citizen, who is so fond of cigarettes Marlboro, which did not spare the time and effort and made a movie, or is behind this advertising campaign? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> The Australian branch of British American Tobacco says that the industry is now more concerned with adapting to the new rules, than advertising. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The tobacco industry have even gone to such measures as the sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these states make a complaint to the World Trade Organization, arguing that trade was subjected to unfair restrictions, despite the fact that the trade relations of all these countries with Australia are very small. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> According to Tanya Plibersek, the government is discussing with other countries adopting similar laws on their packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> In 2001, Canada was the first to introduce a mandatory placement of the photos, warning about the dangers of smoking. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Now it is generally accepted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Considered the possibility of tighter laws in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> A lot of smokers in Australia deliberately disobey innovation. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> These pictures do not hurt me. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I just do not pay attention. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;Just whips out a pack of cigarettes and hiding in your pocket&quot; - says Victor Al Haig, buying cigarettes in photo tumors of the oral cavity on the pack. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> Honestly, the only thing that can make me quit - it&apos;s my little girl. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yu, store manager of tobacco King of the Pack in the heart of Sydney, argues that the same package has complicated the task of placing the goods on the shelves </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;I used to have to unload the new party was leaving an hour, and now four o&apos;clock,&quot; - he complains. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government had to take and completely ban cigarettes, we would then say, what to do, okay, it&apos;s over, close the store,&quot; - he says, throwing his hands up. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> Bored in the world of electronic networks and persistent connections - it&apos;s not so bad. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> This Thanksgiving I unexpectedly had to spend five hours in the airport because of our aircraft mechanical problems were found and it was replaced by another aircraft, and we waited. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> Thus, I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I will not lie to you. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight - it&apos;s really boring, and there is not much help either books or magazines, or iPhone, or even a duty-free shops. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> Recently, however, more and more scientists and experts in child development are in favor of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> They say that in certain situations, for us and for our children to miss is not so bad. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> This forces the brain to be distracted by interesting related topics that may contribute to creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> And because in today&apos;s world we are constantly in front of some screen, the benefits of boredom pass us by. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> Maybe we need to strive to boredom? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> At the same time there. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> We&apos;ll get back to that. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Previously, I, like many, thought that boredom - the invention of relatively recent times, when people have more free time. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> It is not, says Peter Thuy, a professor of Greek and Roman history, Canadian University of Calgary, author of &quot;A fascinating story of boredom&quot; (Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011). </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;In fact, boredom boasts a very ancient history,&quot; - he said. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> On the walls in Pompeii Latin inscriptions found about boredom, dating back to the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> This leaves open the question of how we understand the boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of boredom changed frequently. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> After reviewing the research on this topic and by asking the target group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition : boredom - is when people &quot;want, but can not do what would have brought them the satisfaction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a bored person is not doing something that he wanted to do. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> When apathy to do anything you do not want. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> Major in boredom experienced by, he says, is &quot;impaired attention and the associated worsening of mood and feeling that time passes slowly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> According to the description boredom may seem very similar to depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> However, Professor Eastwood said that despite the possible link between these states, bored people see the causes of the problems in the world and circumstances, and people experiencing depression, see a problem in itself. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes we think that we are bored, when in fact it &apos;s just hard to concentrate on anything. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In his study, &quot;An Unused mind : the definition of boredom in terms of attention,&quot; published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues refer to the earlier experiments, the participants who listened to the voice recording, reading a magazine. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some participants also heard the loud sounds of irrelevant TV programs included in the next room, others heard the same sound at a low volume, so that they could barely make out, and the third group only listened to the voice recording without any audio track. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Those participants who heard the TV volume is low, indicated that they were bored, most others - it was hard to concentrate, but they do not know the cause of it and attributed it to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> When we try to focus on the exciting and challenging task, interruption of attention can cause boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neurology at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> On the other hand, when we are doing something uninteresting, &quot;for example, looking at the flow of products on an assembly line in search of marriage, distracting music can help prevent boredom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> It is believed, he continues, is that when people start to wiggle in a chair or doodle on a piece of paper, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that in fact such actions do not just help to relax physically. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;Research has shown that children who do not forbid to fidget and spin, learn better and remember more information than children who are required to sit still,&quot; - says Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> At some point, we all experience the boredom : if the flight is delayed (as in my case), listening to the monotonous speech, looking uninteresting film. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> However, different people show different degrees of inclination to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> In the 1980s, for the measurement of individual characteristics, researchers have developed a special &quot;scale propensity to boredom.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2334"> To determine an estimate on such a scale used questions and statements such as &quot;Much of what I have to do monotonous and monotone&quot; or &quot;I&apos;m too much fun, so everything is not enough time.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> With the help of the questionnaires, researchers have found that boys are more often bored girls - said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - especially in the presence of a variety of external stimuli. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> However, in general, young people are often bored at all. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he is contacted by pager with nearly 400 teens and their parents 7-8 times a day. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He obtained the following results : 32% of teens said that they are bored in school and during homework, and 23% said that they are bored outside of school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> However, only 3% of parents said that they are bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson notes that he has no information about what would have similar data about boredom now, 21 years later. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> However, he knows that &quot;adolescence is the peak tendency to boredom&quot;, mainly because children and adolescents do not allow you to fully decide what they do. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> Let&apos;s go back to my original question : boredom helpful? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes not, because in extreme manifestations it, studies show, can encourage people to absurd and dangerous physical acts, risky gambling or misuse of certain substances in an attempt to get rid of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have wondered about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich, devoted to the study of this problem for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;So our brain tells us that we should do something else, this is boring,&quot; - says Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at New York University. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> However, this is the brain does not always know exactly what to do better. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If you get bored and you will direct this energy to play the guitar or culinary experiences, you&apos;ll make yourself better. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> However, if you get to watch TV, you will get better only for a time, and soon it will pass. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> Therefore, if your child is bored and you give it a iPad, it will cease to be bored, but he has learned to deal with boredom alone or under any other way to manage your time and employment - says Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> &quot;But such self- regulation skills are utilized in a variety of situations,&quot; - he says. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your child learns not only to occupy yourself with something yourself, it is also learning self-control at all. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I do not think I need to somehow magnify boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> But consider it a bad thing is not worth it. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Rather, it should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action and technology. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Eastwood agrees. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;We see it so often that we need to experience boredom, despite the fact that boredom - this is extremely unpleasant, an unquenchable desire to do something meaningful,&quot; - he said. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> In fact, people tend to somehow disconnect from the constant worries and just relax. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In today &apos;s world we are accustomed to constant over-stimulation of the senses - he says - and when there is silence, we get lost and do not know what to do.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> It is not clear how the new law will apply to legalize marijuana in Colorado </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Anthony Orozco, nineteen- player football team and the student community college in southeast Colorado charged with a criminal offense of what will soon be perfectly legal throughout the state : storage of marijuana and a small portion of the tube, in which he smoked it. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Mr. Orozco says that one day in September, he and his friends were in Lamar and riding in a car on the prairie near the border with Kansas, when they were stopped by police. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After police found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a summons to court for possession of drugs and possession of drug paraphernalia - minor offenses, for each of which is owed a fine of$ 100 - and set a date for the hearing. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;We were treated like criminals,&quot; - says Mr. Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But if the offender is he? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> As a result of the uncertainty that has continued for several weeks after the Colorado voted to legalize marijuana in small amounts for fun, the decision of hundreds of small court cases depends not so much on the law as the place of examination. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Allegations of minor offenses related to marijuana, has removed hundreds of cases here and in the state of Washington, which took a similar measure. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> Police stations have ceased to press charges for people aged 21 and older for possession of small doses that would be considered legal as soon as a couple of weeks the law comes into force. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> However, in more conservative districts Colorado prosecutors have decided to consider the merits associated with marijuana, and still prosecuted for possession of the drug. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time, in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountains of the West to vote for it in order to prevent the appearance in their new locations, licensed staff of shops selling marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;All of this is developing so fast that I did not even know what to expect next,&quot; - says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in the town of Aurora east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Representatives of regulatory bodies in the state of Washington also puzzled scratching his head. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They will have to create rules to determine the order of licensing the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all this must be done before December 1, 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that Colorado is good or bad, is ahead of most other states in the resolution of questions of use of marijuana for medical purposes at first, but now for fun. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;In Colorado, a more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example,&quot; - says Brian J. Smith, a spokesman for the Council to regulate the production and marketing of alcoholic beverages in the state of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But no one can do more, admits Mr. Smith than to put forward some suggestions and hope that it will work. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;We have no real precedent on which we could focus,&quot; - he said. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The Bill of Washington, called I- 502, come into force on 6 December and the whole year will plunge state into a state of uncertainty, when the system of state licensing yet, and the right of possession of marijuana is legalized. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> And there &apos;s still difficult technical issues to be solved in this period, for example, how to find a balance between the order of the State of &quot;adequate access&quot; to a licensed marijuana with a ban on the trade of a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;It is particularly difficult to locate licensed trading companies marijuana in the city, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs,&quot; - says Ben Livingston, a representative of the newly established research group &quot;Center for the legalization of marijuana.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2380"> Nov. 21 Police Chief Oates of Aurora sent his subordinates to an email message that the Prosecutor&apos;s Office will no longer attract persons under the age of 21, to account for the possession of a small amount of marijuana, and that the police stops to convict people in these violations, &quot;starting from this moment&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> The police chief Oates said police will monitor compliance in the rules governing the activities of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and will prosecute traffickers and drug dealers. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> Weld County District Attorney in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, is a more rigorous approach to the subject. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote on the bill, he said that his office will continue to prosecute for possession of marijuana, mainly in order to encourage people to use it for treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> Currently 119 persons charged with possession of two ounces or less of marijuana, even though many of them are accused and other violations. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;The duty of the institution - be prosecuted for acts that are considered criminal at the time they were committed,&quot; - said Mr. Buck said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The reaction was mixed, even in places such as rural Mesa County, where members vote rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> Police Grand Junction, the largest town in the county, more than being called to account for the adult possession of small amounts. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> District Attorney Pete Hauttsinger upheld the decision, but also decided not to withdraw the charges on already open cases related to marijuana possession. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I believe that to enforce the law as long as it does not change - our duty,&quot; - he said. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Despite the fact that 55% of Colorado residents who took part in the vote in favor of this decision, the inclusion of the use of marijuana for entertainment in the state and the legal system will not be easy. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> A controversial reaction of residents in different parts of the state revealed the ambiguity of the relationship of the local authorities to experiment with marijuana state. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> &quot;I district attorneys in this matter there is a cultural barrier,&quot; - says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing convicted of possession of marijuana, and a local representative of the National Organization for the reform of the laws on marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;They &apos;ve been chasing people for this, that now can not truly accept the fact that this is not a crime,&quot; - he said. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Colorado and Washington - the first state in which a small amount of marijuana are the same as for alcohol - is destined to become an experimental field across the country to test the idea of legalizing drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> Supporters of legalization and state officials plan to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time, they cautiously await instructions from the federal authorities, who are still planning to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a federal crime. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Supporters of legalizing marijuana are hoping that the Justice Department will give way in this matter. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Despite several arrests have received considerable attention of traders and patients who use marijuana for medical reasons, the federal government in most cases, has given the nod to trade marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> Agents of the Bureau of Narcotics are unlikely to break into the house to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to become blind to the state government regulated recreational marijuana shops, which are allowed under the new law, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser the fight against drugs in the Obama administration. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the actions of federal authorities. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Even before the presidential elections, some local governments have approved a moratorium on the opening of new stores for the sale of marijuana, and so are not able to open earlier than a year. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week, Montrose, a town in the western part of the state, has put forward to the six-month ban on the trade in marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We do not want to be in such a position that we will issue a license to someone, then it will cause serious problems at the federal level,&quot; - says Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our town voted against the amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local election and the fact that he voted for the staff. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> There are still many unresolved issues. </seg>

<seg id="2438"> I did not know that teachers not only turned a blind eye to the persecution of conservative students, but also they will gladly take part in it. </seg>

<seg id="2556"> The hardest profession in the world : the miners from Kawah - Idzhena </seg>
<seg id="2557"> For four euros Indonesian miners risk their lives and health, vtaskivaya 70 kilograms of sulfur on top of a volcano on the steep rocky trails </seg>
<seg id="2558"> There are people for whom they work - hell, while others are literally working in hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> Among them Anto Vijaya, one of 400 miners, who earn their living in the mining of sulfur, Kawah Ijen volcano, located on the eastern Indonesian island of Java. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> Every day Anto down to the bottom of the crater, where the sulfur dioxide rising from the depths of the Earth, freezes on contact with the air. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> Splitting off huge chunks of sulfur, the total weight of which can reach up to 70 kg, it puts them in two bamboo baskets, baskets heaped on his shoulders and carries them up the steep rocky road. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> To the summit of the volcano, whose height is 2,386 meters, only 250 meters, but exhausted baggage handlers require more than 40 minutes to get up at a snail&apos;s pace, barely holding the balance and carefully feeling for the road, so as not to stumble and fall off a cliff. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> They know that one wrong move could cost them their lives, as happened to a tourist from France, which fell a few years ago from the rocks Kawah - Idzhena. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> Miners from Kawah - Idzhena earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulfur, which is extracted </seg>
<seg id="2565"> Once at the top, they find their way between the tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys from the circus and tired carrying heavy baskets, stepping up to three miles of weights that the mining company has placed a little higher, at an altitude of 1,850 meters. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> It is about PT Ngrimbi Kandy, the company that operates since 1960 this volcano and it is better not to tell their employees that they pay 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) per kilogram of sulfur. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents), petrochemical plants, because this mineral is common in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, and even dynamite to bleach sugar. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> &quot;As is the norm carrying 70 pounds, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each best-selling&quot; - explains us Anto, who usually performs three daily carrying. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> He spends three hours on each of them and in the end feels overwhelmed, but they allow it to accumulate 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> While this seems minuscule for such an inhuman effort is three times more than what he would have earned in the field. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> &quot;Daily wage miners is very high by local standards, where a collection of coffee are paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the average monthly wage is equal to two million rupees (167 euros),&quot; - explains the porter, who had previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the site was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family in Banyuwangi, a town not far from the volcano, for good reason, which in Indonesia is as devastating as sulfur : &quot;I married a girl from Bali, where some Hindus, and brought it to Java, so she converted to Islam.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2573"> We Anto asthma, he breathes with difficulty, constantly coughing, and he watery eyes due to toxic gases </seg>
<seg id="2574"> At 27, Anto spent three years at the risk of an in - Kawah Ijen, sulfur which has already started to affect him in spite of the presence of masks and special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, coughing constantly, and he has watery eyes due to toxic gases, which highlights the volcano. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> This is the price he must pay for the achievement of their dreams. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> &quot;I Work for two more years, because I want to open a shop or learn French or Spanish,&quot; - he promises more than acceptable English. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> Punished life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, a waiter or a clerk at the hotel, but instead it does the work mule. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> Dividing the dirty wooden hut with the other porters, he gets up every day at two in the morning, because sulfur does not cease to flow at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns to blue and shines amid the gloom. </seg>

<seg id="2581"> About 400 porters dragged baskets with gray on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Despite the high profits, the mining company is not mechanized mining sulfur in order to save costs and do not provide any equipment porters who work at their own expense and with such deprivation. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> In fact, they do not get even a part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euro) fee for the photo shoot, which, along with the entry ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of the reserve charge tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and its people - mules. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> &quot;This work for the cattle, and not for the people,&quot; - said Badrusin, chunky porter 42, who spent at Kawah Ijen - three decades, ever since I left college. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> Able to lift up to 110 pounds, he makes sure that the work will suffer &quot;as much as it can&quot; because he needed money for the education of their three children, aged 18 to 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> Do not retire, die here, because the volcano - this is my life </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Although the sulfur burns the throat and burning eyes when the wind suddenly changed and catches the miners in the dense columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardy that no one complains about his serious illness... more serious, obviously, than their usual breathing problems, arthritis, knee pain and sores on their shoulders, which are deformed under the weight of the baskets. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Balancing a basket on her back, now only Unaynik can lift 50 pounds in their 53. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Every day, he and his comrades take out 15 tons of sulfur from a volcano that three trucks transported to a warehouse in Tamansari, overcoming the distance of 18 kilometers along a narrow path among the bushes. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> &quot;Do not retire, die here, because the volcano - this is my life&quot; - says Unaynik wide open mouth, which is missing a few teeth. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> Of his five children, the eldest, aged 30, also works sulfur carrier. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Time passes, but perpetuates poverty from one generation to one of the most difficult things to do in the world : whatever it is that human mules with Kawah - Idzhena. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore is looking for children to save the economy </seg>
<seg id="2594"> Singaporeans blamed career, stress, and housing prices and the lack of education of children. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> &quot;The population of Singapore to grow.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I am a patriot, husband, you are my wife patriot, fulfill our civic duty and create a life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the advertising peppermint patties, but in spite of this - or perhaps because of it - this video has become a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> These phrases are part of rap which uses local sayings like, &quot;Let&apos;s put bao (bun) in the oven&quot; to make fun of the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> Advertising agency that made this video, BBH, cherishes the hope that with the help of advertising they will be able to draw attention to this issue in an entertaining way. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to people fulfilled &quot;its national debt.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2601"> This thing is only for the web, so we had to make it fun and funny. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> This is a major problem in the country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> We are the world&apos;s worst for the reproduction of their own kind, so we felt that this is an issue that we need to touch. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government was trying to do many things, such as to launch a perfume with pheromones or organized parties DatingCity (blitz - dating). </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily worked. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> So we thought, why do not we make the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, namely to compose rap? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 children </seg>
<seg id="2608"> Who does not see it so lightly, this is the government of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> It spends 1,300 dollars a year for a policy to inspire the citizens in the birth of more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> The State&apos;s interest for married couples and parents providing up to$ 15,000 per child, extending maternity leave and provide tax relief. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But all this has a low efficiency. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore - this rich and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known conservatism of his leadership and his strict public control. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national management in terms of population, is currently at the level of 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> Last time it was below 2 - what is known as a percentage of substitution - in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> So why Singaporeans do not have more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Tan Wei Ming, director of the Division of Policy for couples and families of the National Office of the population, says the reason for that &quot;better education&quot; and &quot;a wide range of career opportunities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;It allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, in addition to weddings and starting a family,&quot; - she explains. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes in social norms contribute to the growth of the number of bachelors and the postponement of marriage and childbearing, resulting in decreased fertility in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, immigration policy, which is aimed at a sharp increase in immigration to counter population decline, causing resentment among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore, there are web sites that thrives barely concealed xenophobia in many of the new immigrants, especially the Chinese, which has been criticized for keeping wages low and unwillingness to integrate. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> Increased immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that last year, the ruling party of Singapore received the worst result of the elections since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> After the election, there was an attempt to solve a problem with quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> unexpected consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While the drop in the birth rate has some influence on the nation&apos;s economic growth, tax revenues, spending on health care and immigration policy, an example of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government is making efforts to not built as a small housing. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> For example, it began to affect the real estate sector. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> Manual for Urban Development transferred to the control of the number of small flats, known as the &quot; shoe box &apos;that can be built in certain areas of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These apartments are 46 square meters sold very well. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> However, it is believed that they can facilitate the idle lifestyle and deprived of the stimulus developers who want to build a great family home. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yu Sun, CEO of the homebuilding company EL Developers, says that their &quot;shoe boxes&quot; sold much faster than the large specimens. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are more popular in the sense that these apartments are bought for a few days, even weeks, faster than the larger apartments. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> As a result, our cash flows are increasing. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> However, he acknowledged that the new rules give clearer guidance to developers, which previously put obstacles if they want to offer too many small apartments in the project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> too strained </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore - a city -state. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> While these new rules could be a step in the direction of increasing the national birth rate, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial district center, it seems that they will not have much effect. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;People are very overstretched, expensive housing, as well as education, and because of this, many people are postponing it,&quot; - says the young manager. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> Other people can have children. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> &quot;But for me it is important to have your own money and time,&quot; - said another young man 20 years of age. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> Men and women mention their careers, stress, and the price of housing and education as reasons that prevent them from having children. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> So, as the government had not sought to encourage its citizens to have more children, in regard to procreation, the last word belongs to Singaporeans. </seg>

<seg id="2677"> Unlike Jorge, this boy would load photos acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Yes, I would do it if people do not like me, or if I want to. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> &quot;Although I know it&apos;s kibermobbing&quot; - confirms it. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> Key Issues </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Marelos Porras, a teacher of English and an expert on education and training, said that in order to guide the children and young people need to understand that the purpose of social networking - to inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;The Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but with the advent of these sites have changed the rules of the game&quot;, - she said. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Porras indicates that academic Marc Prensky, a master of pedagogy at Yale University and author of Labor Digital natives and immigrants, these terms are invented to explain this phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> Digital natives are they, the children and young people who were born in the era of technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we are still learning themselves,&quot; - she said. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> Explains that this issue is complex, &quot;because we ask them to have certain criteria that may or may not distribute, publish or say in an age when maturity is not enough for that.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;It is also to be selective, while the most important thing for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends, regardless of the consequences,&quot; - she added. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to him, the most effective way to show that such confidentiality for children and adolescents - to ask questions that make them reflect. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;Talking to them that they did not do it, it is useless,&quot; - she added. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Porras then lists some of the options : there are things that you would not tell a stranger, so why do you do it online? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, would you like it if you posted a photo like the one you posted about my friend? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> Do you know what others publish about you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> When you sign party photos, ask permission if you have other people to mark them? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And another thing, all you need to know what you&apos;re doing at every moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> One more point - is to make them understand that they need to behave online as well as doing it offline. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> Rules are the same. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;Beyond the Internet a person behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles should be the same in social networks,&quot; - she said. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> vigilance </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Estuardo Guardia, a university lecturer, professor of elementary education and educational consultant, explains the need for the heads of the families conscientiously read the policy of social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> Understanding each of the items they have good reasons for talking to children about the premises of opening an account online. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;For example, the age and the fact that it is permissible to distribute or publish,&quot; - he said. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> According Gaurdiya, the key question - to remind the children a lesson, &quot;Do not speak to strangers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2703"> Unasur summit ends without disclosure of the Lima Declaration </seg>
<seg id="2704"> VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the promulgation of the Declaration of Lima, the previously announced and theoretically signed binding family members. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> Efe has repeatedly tried to get access to the document signed at the next meeting of the VI Summit of the UNASUR, but sources from the Office of the Presidential Administration, and pointed to the main page that it will transfer after closing, but later confirmed that at some point it will be published on the web site of the Peruvian government. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> Questions about the text, they indicated that the contents were described by President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during brief statements to the press. </seg>

<seg id="2710"> The only document prevalent during the day, there was a list of participating presidents, which angered the hundreds of journalists from different national and international media who have requested more information. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> Subsequently, the administration of President of Peru sent an email to the media, &quot;the final declaration&quot; of the summit, but it is a statement of Humala, not an official document, which concluded the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> Last October, Peru hosted III Summit of South American and Arab Countries (ASPA), and at that time, despite the fact that this insistence of the press, too, has not been published so-called Lima Declaration, which was previously announced. </seg>

<seg id="2718"> &quot;Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law and the peaceful resolution of disputes, covenants and international tribunals,&quot; - said Pinera, and greeted with a handshake on the background of Humala flags of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> Confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the International Court occurred immediately after the Columbia protested this week Pact of Bogot√°, under which it recognized the subordination of the verdict of the International Court following the decision of the maritime boundary with Nicaragua, which it considered erroneous. </seg>

<seg id="2726"> As Europe is in crisis, &quot;the economic union (Latin America) should have no triumfatorskoy basis, and should serve to expand our manufacturing base and anticipate a better future for our cities,&quot; added Humala. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> &quot;We decided to give privileges to a group of 31 landmark projects that will improve communication spaces in South America, especially in rural and border areas... uniting our country and creating new economic schemes,&quot; - said the president of the Peruvian in the message. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> Among these projects, he mentioned that the five belong to Peru, and limited transverse axes in its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and the two are aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details. </seg>

<seg id="2731"> The need to Latin America remained well-being of the region and the world, would be united, and had good relations between neighbors, was a different theme, emphasized by the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before proceeding to participate in a regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City for talks in a respectful form of the maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of the international Court contested Bogota. </seg>

<seg id="2739"> Peru has a temporary presidency of the regional bloc. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> &quot;South America should learn from Europe in the integration of citizenship&quot; : Rafael Correa </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, has confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is the goal, in which &quot;South America, in which case, yes, should learn from Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Correa, who participated in the VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, Peru, told state television that the Europeans &quot;were killing each other during World War II&quot; and other collisions, &quot;but now they&apos;re practically the fatherland.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2743"> He defended, in this context, the project is the establishment of a South American citizenship, which favor the member countries of UNASUR. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> &quot;It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors who want to return us to the past&quot; - he warned. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> Ecuadorian president showed himself, in addition, a supporter of the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS), under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and taking into account those who signed the Pact of San Jose on Human Rights. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Those who lectures, never assume no obligation, and we, the South Americans, by contrast, are signing it. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> &quot;It is inexplicable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington and is funded by the United States,&quot; - he said, alluding to the political asylum given by Ecuador WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa assured that he does not regret the decision, because what happened to him, he did not betray his principles, and comply with its &quot;deepest values of democracy and human rights.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2749"> He added that in his time &quot;had some suspicions that Assange will be extradited to a third country and will not be honored process.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2750"> He criticized, in addition, the Swedish justice for the requirement to come into its territory for questioning about alleged sex crimes, while the &quot;self Swedish law considers it possible to implement it by video, which can be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa confirmed that there is a risk of deterioration of physical and mental health of Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> &quot;I have not spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a small pulmonary problem, nothing serious,&quot; - said the head of the Ecuadorian state. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> What really is, so is the risk of deterioration of his physical and mental health due to confinement in a small space without the ability to do the exercises in the air. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> &quot;It affects the health of any individual,&quot; - he added. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Correa said that the solution to the problem of asylum granted Assange in June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, by providing guarantees of immunity, which will allow him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, and stressed that the talks were in London about searching address the imprisonment of the founder WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We do not negotiate about human rights, the word in this case we do not use, but there were constant discussions. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;The solution is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts because Assange&apos;s lawyer, Baltasar Garzon, is a series of processes in the various European institutions,&quot; - he mentioned. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And expressed the opinion that &quot;if the UK tomorrow will provide a guarantee of immunity, this is over.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2759"> While in Sweden, as it allows her perfectly legislation and how it has done in other cases, interrogate Assange lady at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or interrogate him on Skype, tomorrow, this problem will be exhausted. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa took the opportunity to prove himself as a defender of press freedom and said he did not tolerate &quot;mediocrity, dishonesty and lies that distort the freedom of expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2761"> &quot;The main enemies of press freedom is not spoiled by the villains policy, and bad journalists, supporting the bait, blackmail and extortion,&quot; - he said. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In this aspect, he was satisfied that these are not journalists, &quot;neither the bankers nor the bourgeois hegemonic countries do not prevail in Ecuador,&quot; and added that, being re-elected, &quot;will deepen the revolution to continue development in the right direction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Correa also supported the decision to retain a veto Paraguay UNASUR at least until the next election, arguing that the organization &quot;must be firm and do not tolerate opportunism and supporting coups under the guise of legality,&quot; because in reality, &quot;it destroyed the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2764"> Ecuadorian president found, in addition, &quot;totally justified&quot; his desire Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos&apos; lead is now in talks with Nicaragua&apos;s maritime borders between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice, The Hague, which was in favor of the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> At the moment the decision is not enforced. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> This is a problem between the South American and Central American countries. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together. </seg>

<seg id="2781"> Deaths from AIDS today - the result of late diagnosis </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was told that his AIDS test was positive. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;I was stunned as if&quot; - he recalls that difficult, despite all the tact a doctor now. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> The boy hid it from his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> Deciding to cope with the disease himself, he wanted to learn about it as much as possible. And his efforts were met - he celebrated his 43rd birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> Fabrice - one of the &quot;oldest&quot; of HIV- patients of the hospital Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he was in 1994, overcoming many obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> He is living with a diagnosis of &quot;human immunodeficiency virus&quot; (HIV) for 22 years. In the early 90&apos;s in it would be hard to believe - too few treatment options exist then, too little is known about the disease, too discriminated against patients. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> Thus, even the director of the clinic, Mexican Institute of Social Security did not want to say goodbye to him, &quot;because he was cut.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> In other words, at the time the sentence was to have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> It is now possible to survive in this syndrome, and to do so without compromising the quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> However, unaware of their disease until now, many people are coming, when the virus has already caused damage, &quot;exhausted&quot; their immune system and they are suffering from opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> Later in &apos;31 after the advent of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, &quot;a great achievement at the moment is that the survival of patients who start treatment in a timely manner, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same,&quot; - said the head of the department of HIV HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, referring to the fact that this information was confirmed in April of this year in the prestigious scientific journal. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> Infectious disease specialist and an expert on HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, scientists have come to the conclusion that AIDS is not a sentence, but the duration and quality of life depend on the degree of impairment of the immune system in the patient at the beginning of the diagnosis, with the best expectancy lives of those who do not use drugs : up to 30 years with the number 200 CD4, and up to 50 years when the reported 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Simply put, the above means that the one who gets diagnosed HIV - positive at the age of 25 years, according to these terms, &quot;maintaining control, be able to live without any problems up to 75 years,&quot; - he explained. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> To evaluate this progress, we should remember that the life expectancy of Mexicans today the average is 76 years. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Although the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (Annual Report), it is also true that with the advent of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database died. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths have been registered by May of this year, however, argues that there is widespread access to antiretroviral drugs in 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> - Why there are still deaths? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> - Personally, I think that the problem of access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> So I imagine it&apos;s because things are in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> At least the last 12 years, we have had no shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients come too late, because they do not know their infected status, that is, in the later stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> He led the crushing data: &quot;Nine out of ten patients come when some already have an opportunistic infection, you need to do to have a greater impact on overall mortality, as it is to diagnose at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples for the detection of mass scale, for all the people who ask it.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2803"> In its proposal, agree experts and officials of the State Council on AIDS prevention in Jalisco (COESIDA), as well as the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who asked for the check to a private lab, impelled only by the fact that it is made by his friend and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffered Kaposi &apos;s sarcoma, a cancer which is one of the most common complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some people think that they will die, and did not want to know. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;If going to die, I&apos;d rather get drunk three times a week,&quot; - they say. But not in my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> There are positive changes, I eat well, do exercises, take medication. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> To date, his parents only know that he is a cancer survivor. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I live a normal life like any other. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;I&apos;m working, I have a lot of classes, I travel, I conduct an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, taking care of yourself and the other person&quot; - listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share their personal lives with MILENIO JALISCO, to coerce his statement as who now, in the context of the World AIDS Day, experiences fear. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> Let us check if there was a risk of infection, even as soon as possible to know whether they are HIV- positive or better, and if they already have a diagnosis, and let them know that they can live like any other human being responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> This sums up the theme of his message against AIDS in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Condoms behind the counter </seg>
<seg id="2814"> Large gap between health programs and common citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, which addressed the problem of HIV-related. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And the greatest is prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In areas devoted to this task, &quot;actually increased condom distribution, before we were given one or two, and now we give a hundred packages, and it&apos;s very good, but it turns out that there are those who are now still do not have access to condom,&quot;- he said. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> &quot;Why do they tell you?&quot; is a popular question with malice and condemnation from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy staff and health care workers who do not want to hear teenagers assured propagandist. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> I propose to change this inefficient distribution, that condoms were not only behind the counter, and that hundreds of them were in vending machines in public toilets in places that are often visited by young people. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> This does not encourage promiscuity. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> This is not a payment of beer and motel Governor Emilio Gonzalez said when asked whether it is possible distribution of condoms under his leadership. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> &quot;It&apos;s not sexy, it&apos;s best to make condoms available to those who are already practicing sexual activity&quot;, - he said. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Key data in Jalisco </seg>
<seg id="2824"> Registered 13,435 total cases (1,317 and 12,158 AIDS -HIV). </seg>
<seg id="2825"> State ranks 4th place in the national ranking of new and total cases of AIDS and the 13th of HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> 92% of infections related to sexual way, 6% through the blood, and 2% to perinatal way. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> An estimated 50,000 people are living with HIV, as there is one documented case is 4 to 5 people who do not know it. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> Given the ratification of the United States Court of Appeals decision, which cancels the debt restructuring of the Group Vitro, achieved through bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico, the script sets the fatal precedent for any national company with offices in the neighboring country, which has a solvency problems. </seg>

<seg id="2837"> In fact, Vitro was not the first time that this scheme is adopted. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose inter-company debts guaranteed by the federal institute bankruptcy proceedings. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> It is also true that subtracting voices branches, one way or another creditor Vitro, who fought against him in the courts of the United States, namely funds &quot;vultures&quot; like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not reach the majority. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> The vote was 45 to 37 percent against. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> This data puts the Court of Appeal. </seg>
<seg id="2842"> On the other hand, he accuses Vitro in a difficult situation with which she has faced since 2008, affected by a severe economic crisis that has overtaken the United States, attacking the country. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> So far, the family firm produces Gonzalez Sada appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal itself to vote came to his plenum, that is, the five judges, in view of the fact that they voted only three. </seg>

<seg id="2868"> An avid traveler basketball Hector &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes was more than 60 years is associated with the sport, and thanks to him, has traveled the world. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Few people in Puerto Rico stores in memory so much basketball history as Hector &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> And it before brain hemorrhage confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years as a player of small categories, Team Supreme Basketball League commissioner and head of BSN from Bayamon Cowboys and the president of the Basketball Federation. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> &quot;I have performed many roles in basketball during his lifetime, including several at the same time as when I was president of BSN, CEO and President of the National Federation of the team in the 90s&quot; - says Reyes during a visit to Primera Hora to his home in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife, for over 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> &quot;Basketball was my life.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Reyes was not exaggerating, making this assertion. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The walls of his home, almost all decorated with photographs and memorabilia collected over his long way to show this. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Bayamon heart </seg>
<seg id="2876"> With the greatest emotions he keeps those that remember his way through the Cowboys since the mid 50&apos;s as a player until 1982, when the 15th anniversary of his speech as co - agent or contract. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> &quot; They were my best years, I have enjoyed the most, because he had the opportunity to be part of the eight championships with the Cowboys in 1967 as an agent with the agent or supervisor. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> There were many years of joy, including five championships, held from 1971 to 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> And then I said goodbye to the one in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy in the BSN. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> Since then, and continue to lead became &quot;Cuco&quot; Ortiz, who was a great administrator, &quot;- said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> I remember that Gene Bartow, who was heading here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham) told me : &quot;I got you a very good player, the growth of 6&apos;7&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> &quot;Would you?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2883"> And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players who have been at Puerto Rico. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Bartov then recommend a sniper Raymond Gauss, who became a citizen and has become one of our top scorers. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> I remember that I said that if I brought the championship Mincy Bayamon, Gauss would help to win another one. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> Cowboys in the championship Gauss I enjoyed, but at a distance, because by 1988 already was listed head of the federation. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> By the time I preferred to enjoy his accomplishments and achievements Mincy in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> I remember when we won for the first time in the U.S. during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Then came the World Cup in 1990, where we got fourth place and it had to be bronze, if not for the Canadian judge who made us replay the final game, Reyes said. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> The team from the World Cup in 1990 - this is the best team as the one you &apos;ve ever seen? </seg>
<seg id="2891"> She is among the best, just like the one that defeated the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> But my favorite was the one with the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and broke the U.S. national team, which was quite similar to the one that we have won the bronze medal at the World Championships. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> In the team not only played again Mincy, Gaussian, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and &apos; Pikulina &apos; (Ortiz), but also young (Javier) &apos; Tonito &apos; Colon and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario &apos; Quijote &apos; Morales, who was unable to participate in &apos;90 due to a knee injury. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> The team, which was probably not the best in terms of personnel, but brought us a gold medal and a great joy, there was a team Olympic qualifying tournament in 1995 in Neuquen, Argentina. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> With role- players like &apos; Kanito &apos; Nieves, Pablo Alisea and Rolando Hurruitnera young players in return, temporarily suspended for the mess in the Pan American Championships in Mar del Plata, we won the gold against all expectations. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> Who was the best player in Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Without a doubt, it was a Pikulin Ortiz. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> His performance in international tournaments is impressive. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> No one in Puerto Rico did not dominate at this level as it did Pikulin. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> And that&apos;s not counting his career in various leagues in which he played. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> Who was the best Puerto Rican leader? </seg>
<seg id="2902"> This is a very difficult question. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> We had a very good youngsters, including Julio Toro, Flora Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> From young, I really like the work of Leo Arilla. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation? </seg>
<seg id="2906"> Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 90s in the BSN had up to 17 teams of the season. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> What do you have left to do? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There were things that I wanted to implement, for example, the regionalization of smaller categories. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> For example, the boys from Ponce played only in the area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Now the guys are traveling and playing too much, and it&apos;s unnecessary. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> At least, I can see the fruits of mandatory certification and courses for managers, officials and judges. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> It gives me pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> What are you doing now? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> Most of all I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and sometimes I go to basketball games. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> And, of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Icabel that has always been with me. </seg>

<seg id="2962"> This semester, the professor of religion Stewart Sharma decided to read the course of the end of the world, he knew that he possessed an irresistible lure : the end of the &quot;long count down&quot; the Mayan calendar, December 21, for which many people have seized as evidence that the coming end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> But Sharma had no idea what awaited him in the next couple of months : Catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis, which some call &quot;dolgoarmageddonom&quot; and the growing conflict, which dragged Israel, a place where the Christian end times theorists believe that the Apocalypse will begin. </seg>
<seg id="2964"> &quot;I did not realize that this would be the apocalyptic semester of all&quot; - said Sharma this week, students at Rutgers University - Camden (NJ). </seg>
<seg id="2965"> If we analyze what is happening in the world at the moment, as if we had only 30 days left, it was a really good time. </seg>
<seg id="2966"> And remember that the bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mindset. </seg>
<seg id="2967"> And he&apos;s not the only professor who offers courses on &quot;doomsday&quot; this semester, in theory, the latter in history. </seg>
<seg id="2968"> At Temple University Associate Professor Barry Wacker teaches a course &quot;Media, Culture and the end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2969"> Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2970"> &quot;We analyze why these ideas are spread over time,&quot; - he said, and the way the offer hypothetical scenarios that cause certain human behavior. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> If the nuclear material will fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could break out. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> This month, the students analyzed the films apocalyptic themes and studied how they relate to real world examples. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> &quot;I tried to tell the students about what is possible, probable, probable and possible&quot; - said Wacker. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> The main campus of the University of Pennsylvania professor of Latin American history by Matthew Restall and Amara Solari his colleague, associate professor of art history and anthropology, have teamed up to read the course, which is simply called &quot;The End of the World&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="2975"> &quot;We do not add &apos;2012 &apos;to always be able to read the course again, if the end of the world will not come,&quot; - said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2976"> Despite the &quot;inevitable destruction,&quot; students need to learn, prepare projects and to take final exams. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> At Penn State final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students with no choice but to work &quot;until that night, which supposedly come to an end,&quot; said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2978"> Courses were quite popular. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> &quot;Places ran for two hours,&quot; - said Restall its course for students with a high GPA, which enrolled 35 students. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> We have received e-mails for weeks before the start of the semester from people asking if there is still space. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> Students, in turn, assured that this course is one of the most interesting. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> &quot;I like to see what people do to comfort himself,&quot; - said Brigid Robinson, a 23 -year-old student of the separation of religion and sociology of Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers - Camden. </seg>

<seg id="2984"> Will Vekesa, 25 -year-old student of psychology and nursing, said he watched all the apocalyptic movies. </seg>
<seg id="2985"> &quot;I&apos;ve never heard of a course that would teach this,&quot; - he said. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> I love it. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> But none of the students surveyed - not to mention the professor - did not say that he believes in the doomsday date of December 21. </seg>
<seg id="2988"> &quot;Our first project addressed the Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we have discredited him,&quot; - said Julie Zeglen, 21 -year-old student of the final year at Temple University in West Chester. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> Mayans never predicted the end of the world, it is simply a key point in the calendar, said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> But he noted that there was an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which dates back several centuries in which people react to changes around him, predicting the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> Internet has caused an increase in these speculations. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> &quot;In other places, people do not think about it,&quot; - he said. </seg>
<seg id="2993"> Mainly in the English-speaking world. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> Joseph Doherty, a professor of religion, University of La Salle, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly responded to a question about whether he knew about some informed about the &quot;end of the world&quot; out there. </seg>
<seg id="2995"> &quot;The Philippines did not participate in the end of the world&quot; - he wrote, referring to an order by a higher court. </seg>
<seg id="2996"> We have a pardon from the Pope. </seg>
<seg id="2997"> Restall noted that for a long time talked about the many days of final judgment, and said that if nothing is going to happen on December 21, &quot;people immediately start thinking about the next date&quot; or philosophize, that December 21 is the start of a seven-year period, after that the world will end. </seg>
<seg id="2998"> Students and teachers blithely refer to this date. </seg>
<seg id="2999"> Some said they were going to go to a party, &quot;end of the world.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="3000"> &quot;Maybe someone will call from friends to laugh together,&quot; - commented Samir Ford, 20 -year-old student of communication. </seg>
