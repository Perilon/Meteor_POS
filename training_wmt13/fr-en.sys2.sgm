<seg id="1"> A republican strategy to counter Obama&apos;s re-election </seg>
<seg id="2"> The republican leaders justifièrent their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, the Brennan Centre as a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is more rare in the United States that the number of people killed by lightning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Furthermore, the lawyers Republicans have identified that 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is certain: these new provisions will affect negatively the participation rate. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense, these measures will undermine the US democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike in Canada, US states are responsible for the organisation of federal elections in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is in this spirit that a majority of US governments promulguèrent from 2009 new laws making more difficult the registration process or vote. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has grown after the elections in November 2010 which saw add 675 new republican representatives in 26 states. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Accordingly, 180 projects of laws restricting the right to vote in 41 states were introduced during the one year of 2011. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new election laws require that voters have an identity card with a photograph and proof of US citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Moreover, these laws also reduce the periods of vote in anticipation, invalidates the right to register as a voter polling day and withdraw the citizens have a judicial matter their right to vote. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the 2006 elections, no state american required voters to present an identity card with a photograph. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The Indiana became the first state to make such a demand. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The Supreme Court of the United States in 2008 upheld the constitutionality of the law in Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The authorities are republican empressèrent to extend this to other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Over the past two years, sponsors of the bill in 34 states to force voters to present an identity card with a photograph. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, american citizens have no identity card as the map of universal health insurance. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11% of american citizens, 21 million people of voting age, have no identity cards with photo issued by a government agency in their state. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Furthermore, five million new voters in 2012 will not have such a piece of identity. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the identity card required. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The new restrictions will disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and those on low incomes. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, 25% of african-Americans, 15% of those earning less than $35,000; 18% of people over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not possess the identity card required with photo. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Much more. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The students, voters considered voting more for the democratic candidates are not allowed in several states to use their identity card with a photo issued by their institution. </seg>
<seg id="26"> However, these same states allow members of clubs fishing or hunting who vote more on the republican side to use for voting cards issued by these clubs. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before 2004, no state demanded proof of citizenship to vote. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The Arizona was the first to present such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are american citizens. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures are clearly intended to limit the hispanic vote. </seg>
<seg id="31"> However, it appears that two in three hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Moreover, republican legislators have sponsored in 2011 laws revoking the registration of voters on polling day in eight states. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> These restrictions are not without consequence. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, in the general election in 2004, campaigns for voter registration have contributed to record approximately 10 million citizens. </seg>
<seg id="36"> However, the measures adopted since 2009 have dropped by 17%, the rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In addition, republican legislators have passed laws in five other states to reduce the voting period in anticipation. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of the electorate who voted in advance were african-Americans, when they accounted for 13% of voters in the state. </seg>
<seg id="39"> It was the same with Hispanics. </seg>
<seg id="40"> They accounted for only 11% of voters, but 24% of people who voted in anticipation. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In return, the whites who were 76% of voters were only 46% of the electorate voting in anticipation. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, democratic lawmakers and their supporters are strongly opposed to the adoption of laws restricting voter registration. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes Governing Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The Advocate General of the United States intervened to suspend the laws the more controversial. </seg>
<seg id="45"> They were able to limit the damage in part. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 of 34 states have enacted laws requiring the presentation of an identity card with a photograph. </seg>
<seg id="47"> However, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make more difficult the exercise of the right to vote in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="48"> The criticism Democrats denounced the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed and they see it as a clear objective to influence the results in 2012 in key states. </seg>
<seg id="49"> A report from the Brennan Centre of 2011 shows that states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="51"> But one thing is certain: these new provisions will affect negatively the participation rate. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, these measures will undermine the US democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Screening for prostate cancer: pass the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> Indeed, the PSA test would sometimes incorrect results, with false negative results or false positives, which cause unnecessary medical interventions. </seg>
<seg id="55"> What do hesitate even more men already reluctant to pass the screening tests. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Pass the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We asked the opinion of two specialists. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In the studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between the groups witnesses, so it is difficult to interpret the data and make firm recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, this one, has concluded that a difference in mortality among patients who had a screening and those who have not. </seg>
<seg id="60"> This study has also shown, with a follow-up after 12 years, that between 30 and 40% more likely to have tumors being detected. </seg>
<seg id="61"> I commend the test from 50 years ago, or from 40 years if it has a direct parent who has already had a prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> The men of african-american are also more at risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key is to take the right decision once it has detected a cancer. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There are aggressive cancers and others which are indolents. </seg>
<seg id="65"> We really need to understand the patient the degree of risk of his cancer, offering him the options, not treating necessarily prostate cancers that do not harm the life in the long term, and opting instead, in these cases, to active monitoring of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, many men who we detect a cancer will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives. </seg>
<seg id="67"> We will suggest to the active surveillance and if the disease progresses, we will offer them a treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Increasingly, it determines precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated. </seg>
<seg id="69"> I therefore recommend when even pass the test. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But the important thing is to have a discussion with her doctor to determine if it should happen or not. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In collaboration with the International Society of urologie, Movember has created a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test. </seg>
<seg id="72"> You can download this document (in English, for the moment, a translation will be available shortly) to this http://other.movember.com/fr/lie-health/prostate-cancer-screening </seg>
<seg id="73"> Preventing the disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately there is no recipe for preventing cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress of research, the adoption of good habits of life remains the best way to reduce the risk of damage. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is estimated that if everyone ate well and move enough, we could prevent 30% of cancers. </seg>
<seg id="77"> “If nobody smoked, this rate grimperait to at least 50 %,” says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the canadian company of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="78"> However, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancers are caused by heredity. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Several also remains totally unexplained. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the canadian company of cancer, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the fall in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Cigarette smoking is linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> It is also a risk factor for several others. </seg>
<seg id="83"> This is harmful to people&apos;s health. </seg>
<seg id="84"> “Until today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” laments the spokesman André Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Given encouraging: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, the risk of dying of cancer fall by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> The weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> The embonpoint and obesity also promote the emergence of the disease, according to the SCC. </seg>
<seg id="88"> They heighten the risk of breast, colon and rectum, oesophage, pancreas and cervical cancer. </seg>
<seg id="89"> “Research shows that the practice of regular physical activity during a lifetime protects against bowel cancer,” adds one. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Nutrition </seg>
<seg id="91"> The body also recommends to limit their consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In too much, it raises the risk of colorectal cancer. </seg>
<seg id="93"> The cold meats, too, and they should be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The conservation of the meat by fumage, drying or curing can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances. </seg>
<seg id="95"> “These recent can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer,” explains it. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, many scientists have studied the links between cancer and vitamin supplements. </seg>
<seg id="98"> Their research, however, are not conclusive. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC. </seg>
<seg id="100"> When one of them showed a lower risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase. </seg>
<seg id="101"> The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clear either. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Moreover, Mr. Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking about his concerns and his family history with his doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> “A screening test, it does not give the cancer.” </seg>
<seg id="104"> The Higgs husked </seg>
<seg id="105"> The announcement of the discovery of the likely Higgs has created quite a stir, last summer, and for good reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> We believe that this is the Higgs mechanism responsible for the mass of all things in the universe, nothing. </seg>
<seg id="107"> And then there is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model-our best, or “less worse” explanation of nature and the behaviour of matter-but which has not yet been empirically. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But for physicists, it is still not completely sure that it is the Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know without a shadow of a doubt that we take a genuine new particle, and that it resembles the Higgs particle predicted by the Standard Model. </seg>
<seg id="110"> In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major conference of physical, in Kyoto, seem to confirm, but it still lacks data to be absolutely sure. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Suppose there is the Higgs, since the chances of being wrong seem slim, and see what it is. </seg>
<seg id="112"> There is, in this world, a law inevitably ignored two things that may not be in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> No way to break this rule-and do not try too hard, you are wrong. </seg>
<seg id="114"> But even if the physical particles is a very strange world, it turns out that it, too, has a law like this: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same state “quantum” - this “rule” of roughly in some of their characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="115"> From there, the particles physicists divided into two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In one corner, we find good citizens appointed close, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And the other is shaking the bosons, a nasty bunch of anarchists who have respect for nothing, at least not for this principle, which means that they may well find themselves in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> These bosons will then divide into two groups, according to the website (absolutely extraordinary, incidentally) The Particle Adventure, Laboratoires Berkeley: mésons, that we cannot tackle here, and “particles”, by which the major forces of nature is spreading and that the Higgs is in some way related. </seg>
<seg id="119"> These bosons, it must be said, are not all bestioles as exotic as one might think. </seg>
<seg id="120"> In fact, if you manage to read this chronic, it is thanks to a Higgs of extraordinary banality: the photon, or particle of “light” which is the “messenger” of electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> When a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it “disturbing” the electromagnetic field in this particular place, much as a pebble in a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> This “disturbance” born an electromagnetic waves (of the light, or the infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this agreement is nothing other than a photon-and therefore a “bosons carry strength.” </seg>
<seg id="123"> More stable scope </seg>
<seg id="124"> Even with the Higgs, with the difference that this is another area, the Higgs field, which must be “disturbed” that the Higgs appear. </seg>
<seg id="125"> However, the Higgs is far more stable than the electromagnetic field; for the inflammatory, it must achieve very, very high energies, as if it were a frozen pond which only a very large rock rider could surface. </seg>
<seg id="126"> That is why there is a huge particle accelerator as CERN-the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km of circumference! - to achieve such energies. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with the electromagnetic field again is useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass. </seg>
<seg id="128"> These are not all particles, or all the materials, which interact with the magnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, like magnets, do, but other non-a piece of paper, for example, will never of himself on a fridge. </seg>
<seg id="130"> And in the same way, it is not all particles that interact with the scope of Higgs: those that do have a mass, while others (such as the photon, like) do not have. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Now, what does “can” all this research, ask Mrs Plamondon? </seg>
<seg id="132"> For science, it serves to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows the physicists to scrutinise any gap between the observations and predictions of MS. </seg>
<seg id="133"> They are also several to wish fervently that it is because the slightest difference could open a door on a “new physics” and plug some holes of the Model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, offering no explanation for the seriousness (oups!) or the dark, who form about 80% of the area of the Universe (re-oups!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> But it has not found such differences at CERN until now. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Repercussions </seg>
<seg id="137"> The repercussions of this research in the everyday lives of Mr and Mrs everything-the-world, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no. </seg>
<seg id="138"> Wait: at the beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers of the laser, Laboratoires Bell, did not realize the revolution that their work would trigger. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They saw the scientific applications, but nothing else. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact, we have already said the late physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in the Bell Labs complex, where the laser was invented in 1960 and who has himself developed the first laser continuous (the first were pulsés), in 1962, initially the laser was instead seen as a “gimmick of labo.” </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine … </seg>
<seg id="142"> And then, the applications can also come from all the instruments that surrounds the research. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, this same Willard Boyle has developed a small sensor light in 1969, during its work in perspective. </seg>
<seg id="144"> This sensor, although this was not his original intention, is now “eye” to all the digital cameras of the world, and he has earned the Nobel physics 2009. </seg>
<seg id="145"> This does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it means that, really, you never know … </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care-the best way to die … &amp;pipe; duty </seg>
<seg id="147"> With his committee to die in dignity, Quebec recently debated the delicate question of the end of life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate should resume shortly while a bill is preparing. </seg>
<seg id="149"> However, in this crucial area, much remains to be done. </seg>
<seg id="150"> The Duty tried to look more closely. </seg>
<seg id="151"> A few weeks ago, Mr L. still lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie. </seg>
<seg id="152"> Prostate cancer, which the rongeait had left a respite for two years. </seg>
<seg id="153"> “They gave me five years to live, I did seven years ago,” he says, half-hearted mid-grape, lying in bed in the home of palliative care Victor Gadbois, Beloeil, where it arrived the day before. </seg>
<seg id="154"> “But it is always a shock may not be prepared for it,” he said. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease is his work: a huge weakness which prevents go only to the toilet, and even eating alone. </seg>
<seg id="156"> A very attractive attablé before lunch, he agreed to get help to eat, resigned. </seg>
<seg id="157"> Courageous, sometimes even to smile, talk to strangers who were busy around him, giving him his medicines, offer him a bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The courage of the death. </seg>
<seg id="159"> “My greatest wish is that I am cure of diarrhoea, it is humiliating,” gives it. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the “team has found a cure for this disease. </seg>
<seg id="161"> “During our lives, we learn that a man, pisse rose,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at home Victor Gadbois. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Back at the stage of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> “Stuff depends on the ability of the person” to accept the regression, see it. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because, in the view of several people working in palliative care, of great moments take place in the heart of this decline. </seg>
<seg id="165"> Patients who come to the home of palliative care Victor Gadbois suffer all the cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> They have a prognosis of life a maximum of three months. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stage, the “team of doctors and nurses around them will mean more care” called curative.” </seg>
<seg id="168"> For Mrs. 89 years, the worst fear is dying “aware and suffocated.” </seg>
<seg id="169"> But the disease has made me find my children. </seg>
<seg id="170"> “I have good children,” she adds. </seg>
<seg id="171"> “I have more things in life,” she said, before accepting that it poses a mask to help him breathe. </seg>
<seg id="172"> It expects even, in the coming days, a final visit to his son come to Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> To Victor Gadbois, profligate, with a group of volunteers, the care of the body and aid to food. </seg>
<seg id="174"> This is palliative care, that is when there is nothing else to do. </seg>
<seg id="175"> To make the death more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec, a bed of palliative care for 11 700 people. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This is very little when we know that we will all die one day. </seg>
<seg id="178"> Here, life continues in the best conditions possible, explains the&apos;Dre Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the house. </seg>
<seg id="179"> That is the level of comfort physical, emotional or spiritual. </seg>
<seg id="180"> The dying, take care of the mouth brandy or Pepsi, according to demand. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Diabetics are not obliged to monitor their rate of sugar. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And death is part of daily life. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Yesterday evening, there was a beer to Mr X, who died during the night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> This morning, it was his son who completed the beer at the feet of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="185"> “We support the relatives as patients,” says Nathalie Savard, Director of care. </seg>
<seg id="186"> The house Victor Gadbois, the days to follow but are not alike. </seg>
<seg id="187"> Alongside an old man of 93 years relishing his last House family in court, of stalled in its oreillers while we rap in his honour, a young man of 36 years dying tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, having tried to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> “For six months, there are still three to five beds which are occupied by cancer aged less than 45 years,” worries the&apos;Dre Christiane Martel. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of patients who are admitted to the house Victor Gadbois arrive home, 47% come from the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> It is said that 77% of canadian simply do not have access to palliative care, that is to say care designed to alleviate the suffering when a patient has reached the final stage of his life, be it at home, hospital or nursing home care. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And several agencies, such as the house Victor Gadbois and society of palliative care at home of Greater Montreal, specialise more or less exclusively in the care offered to cancer. </seg>
<seg id="193"> It is precisely this great deficiency in healthcare Quebecois who fear to several doctors specialized in hospice care, the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since October, a manifesto signed by luminaries of palliative care which Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, travels to show their opposition to such a move. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to the&apos;Dre Christiane Martel, the health system Quebecois is not good enough to ensure that everyone is entitled to the palliative care quality before they agreed to proceed to euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Recently, she said, I saw a patient from 14 days to the urgency, in great pain, without making the necessary for the relief. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I fear that patients want to die because they do not receive the appropriate care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> And at the same time, several oncologists is stalking their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognoses. </seg>
<seg id="199"> Hopes for the survival of Helen Richard were already minimal when it abandoned a bruising chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> When I announced to my oncological I arrêtais treatment, she replied that she regretted that I stop to fight, she told. </seg>
<seg id="201"> However, she had told me that I was “finished! </seg>
<seg id="202"> Not all-powerful care </seg>
<seg id="203"> The Martel&apos;Dre believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thanked carers not to have complied with their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a team of palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="204"> But it must be said that palliative care are not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain. </seg>
<seg id="205"> According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care to society of palliative care at home of Greater Montreal, patients would be resistant to treatment for pain in 8% of cases. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the very end of life, doctors have so often use palliative sedation, which amounts to numb the patient until the time of his death, intermittently, is permanently. </seg>
<seg id="207"> We cannot pretend not to hear that part of the suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Increasingly, the patient not relieved will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients who are not relieved always say the same sentence: “I want to die.” </seg>
<seg id="210"> But this does not necessarily mean “I want you euthanasiiez” means “I would be relieved.” </seg>
<seg id="211"> The achievement of this report was made possible by a grant of journalism research institutes in health of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Property scandals of large scale in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Officials of the roads, the entrepreneurs of the BTP, fundraisers of political parties and specialists from the italian mafia told day after day that they know a formidable “system”, involving the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso. </seg>
<seg id="214"> An “industry” that has cost the taxpayers Quebecois, especially in the 1990s and 2000. </seg>
<seg id="215"> “It is curious as the system crumbles since we took the great resources,” Jacques ironise Duchesneau, member of Quebec and former chief of police in Montreal. </seg>
<seg id="216"> It is through him that the scandal has erupted in 2011, through an investigation of substance on embezzlement linked to contracts for road work in Quebec, the liberal prime minister, Jean Charest, had made that backwards. </seg>
<seg id="217"> The report “Duchesneau” established a direct link between industry, hidden financing of parties and corruption of officials. </seg>
<seg id="218"> “Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he insists, the Department of Transport have saved $1 billion on contracts,” some réfrénant their instincts to touch a part! </seg>
<seg id="219"> The Commission Charbonneau “has already brought down two mayors,” he adds, hoping it will “demonstrate the trickery behind individuals.” </seg>
<seg id="220"> A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011 </seg>
<seg id="221"> The ongoing anti-corruption unit, created in 2011, is also working with its army of auditors, investigators and analysts of the government. </seg>
<seg id="222"> More policemen “Marteau squad”, which since 2009, have led the “cartel of sewage” Montreal to put the brake on gonflements contracts … </seg>
<seg id="223"> In recent weeks, it has carried out searches in series and made accusations of fraud and corruption against city officials, as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city suburb. </seg>
<seg id="224"> Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned his post as mayor of Laval, the third city of Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="225"> It is suspected of having received bribes to repeat in exchange for public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Are formally accused by engineers to the roads of Montreal and entrepreneurs of italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito. </seg>
<seg id="227"> This last has raised eyebrows in explaining to the mechanics of the “system” of obtaining government contracts. </seg>
<seg id="228"> Himself has paid for years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a broker linked to the mafia reversait money to Union Montreal party, Mayor Gérald Tremblay. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Mr. Zambito has spread in all directions in the years 2000, giving more 88 000 CAD (approximately 68 000 euros) to the provincial liberal party, especially when in power. </seg>
<seg id="230"> He also admitted having organised a collection of illegal funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister, liberal Nathalie Normandeau. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Contracts for which it drains gonflait costs </seg>
<seg id="232"> Montreal, has the “system” of corruption worked well. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Gilles Surprenant, ex-engineer public work, has detailed before the Commission: in ten years, he has received for construction companies gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totaling $736, in exchange for contracts which it drains gonflait costs. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Other officials of the roads have disclosed that fact smear by swelling from 30% to 40%, the bills by fake extras. </seg>
<seg id="235"> Then an organizer of the mayor, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately turned a blind eye to a budget parallel fueling its coffers with dirty money. </seg>
<seg id="236"> Following the revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal in a major crisis. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected Montreal to sound the alarm. </seg>
<seg id="238"> The mayor of the district of Rivière-of-meadows, in the east of the island, it reacts in 2010 against the sale of a municipal ground bought $5 million and resold … 1.6 million to developers, booming real estate. </seg>
<seg id="239"> 70% of dirty money in election campaigns </seg>
<seg id="240"> The investigation is finally in place, she says she “draws on a thread to understand the workings of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the rot and pinpoint the culprits.” </seg>
<seg id="241"> The process, she said, is “painful but positive”. </seg>
<seg id="242"> We are in the process of cleaning the wound but there should be a unit of inquiry in Montreal and a vigil, not to see the return of dubious practices. </seg>
<seg id="243"> As we do the cleaning. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Regularly. </seg>
<seg id="245"> Jacques Duchesneau note that “officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars,” but is concerned about the role of “elected the ploy”, when they are not in the trempaient magouille! </seg>
<seg id="246"> Estimating that 70% of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, it ironise: “they told me that this was a pale reflection of reality.” </seg>
<seg id="247"> The government proposes to limit Quebecois $100 donations to parties, but this does not change the situation, he said: “as long as we do not strictly limit election spending, there will be dirty money in politics.” </seg>
<seg id="248"> He advocates a thorough review of the system of awarding state contracts and financing parties: “you cannot go lower; get to the bottom of things, with courage, will help rebuild the house on firmer foundations, with more checks and laws.” </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in their own backyard … </seg>
<seg id="250"> “The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!” </seg>
<seg id="251"> This season, you have taken a new size with PSG. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How do you explain this? </seg>
<seg id="253"> This can be explained by an awareness of individual but also by the new dimension of PSG. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Great players arrived. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Every day, I am making progress on their side. </seg>
<seg id="256"> The technical staff has also contributed much. </seg>
<seg id="257"> Daily, these elements lead me to lift my game. </seg>
<seg id="258"> And, in the match, it is easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> Everything is going very quickly in football. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I did not catch fire. </seg>
<seg id="261"> My debut at the centre of included the INF Clairefontaine in my move to St Etienne, I have always made by gradual. </seg>
<seg id="262"> You learn therefore benefit from competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti … </seg>
<seg id="263"> The recruits this summer are used to playing matches at a very high level. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They also know that every training is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="265"> The fact that a player like me want to face and provide the maximum. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my position. </seg>
<seg id="267"> It is supported by deputies as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Ancelotti is the man for the job? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti inspires respect among all the technicians. </seg>
<seg id="271"> Today, he has no equal in League 1 and is one of the best coaches in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He has great experience and has won a lot of titles with clubs brigade. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He flirted with great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think he wins other titles in Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January, I had a discussion with comforting him. </seg>
<seg id="276"> I then outside of a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The confidence it gives me also explains my performance. </seg>
<seg id="278"> How would you on the first part of season PSG? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In League 1 Lyon, we took the place of leader. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we remain in ambush. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our key objectives is the Champions League: we have qualified for the final with the 8es way. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the purpose of a club in this competition? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We will try to go as far as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> Now, anything can happen. </seg>
<seg id="285"> But we have our say in very good european teams. </seg>
<seg id="286"> We want to finish first in our chicken, in Porto, able to receive at the 8th of final return. </seg>
<seg id="287"> The PSG can become a big european club in the short term? </seg>
<seg id="288"> It already has the budget … </seg>
<seg id="289"> To become a major european club, Paris needs to win titles and to register in time. </seg>
<seg id="290"> Today, this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="291"> Financially, the PSG provides the means for this project to fruition. </seg>
<seg id="292"> In League 1, does not win the title, as last season, would be a big failure? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, this would be a big disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year it was really important to pocket the title of champion. </seg>
<seg id="295"> Last season, it has not gone away. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first. </seg>
<seg id="297"> There has been a very big season. </seg>
<seg id="298"> We finished with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> Normally, with 79 points, one is supposed to be champion … </seg>
<seg id="300"> But another team, Montpellier, has done a season even more fantastic. </seg>
<seg id="301"> This year, I think that is good. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Even if the big teams as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are in the fight for the title, I think that we have the weapons to win. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do you think that the media ahead of PSG too? </seg>
<seg id="304"> It is normal that we expected a lot from us in light of what has been invested and the players that we have. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We fully accept. </seg>
<seg id="306"> After, when we won 4-0 at home against Troyes and there are still things to blame us, it is that it is a little frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> One wonders what people expect more. </seg>
<seg id="308"> We can never win 4-0 all weekend. </seg>
<seg id="309"> It is not the FC Barcelona! </seg>
<seg id="310"> We are trying to put in place a draft game. </seg>
<seg id="311"> A team is built with time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> It was shown in the Champions League that they could attend. </seg>
<seg id="313"> Look at Manchester City, who are not, for two seasons, to qualify for the final 8es, they have also made huge spending! </seg>
<seg id="314"> Compared to the sums invested, you imagined with 15 points ahead of the truce. </seg>
<seg id="315"> It was neglect our opponents and the championship in France. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, have been inspired by this new PSG. </seg>
<seg id="317"> This shows that the League 1 is exciting. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that in May we can smile at us saying that, despite all the difficulties, it was eventually prevail. </seg>
<seg id="319"> The PSG seems totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. </seg>
<seg id="320"> Much better that we say that there is a “Zlatan dependence.” </seg>
<seg id="321"> This means that Ibrahimovic is very efficient and it puts a lot of goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> It is time for that and it demonstrates that it is the star of the League 1. </seg>
<seg id="323"> It has shown wherever it is that he was a great player, a global star. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Within the group, we respect the rights and the player. </seg>
<seg id="325"> He also respects the men he has around him. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he has done is truly exceptional. </seg>
<seg id="327"> This prompts others to hoist their level of play. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress. </seg>
<seg id="329"> How have you experienced Euro 2012 with the french team? </seg>
<seg id="330"> As a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I had to participate in this euro. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me from time to grab the game. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I have seen things there and I am stronger. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today, I come to make good matches in selection. </seg>
<seg id="335"> That is what I expect from my baptism with the blues. </seg>
<seg id="336"> We have learned the lessons of what happened in Ukraine and we must now have an exemplary behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="337"> How would you on the first months of Didier Deschamps led the blues? </seg>
<seg id="338"> It has the results for him. </seg>
<seg id="339"> It is well placed in the group description for the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="340"> The breeder is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the wins. </seg>
<seg id="341"> As Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I do not want to make comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="343"> White had reached its target in calling for the euro. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the blues in Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> The right one (1-1) scored on 16 October, Spain is a match founder? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This game has given us confidence. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Everyone has fought for everyone. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Before this clash in Spain, I had never experienced a match like this in my career. </seg>
<seg id="349"> With Bitcoin, pay and sell without the banks </seg>
<seg id="350"> The opposite of monetary exchange current, based on central banks, transactions and identified the costs of treatment between the stakeholders. </seg>
<seg id="351"> In addition, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, from bank monopolies, led to financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible in dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol to secure exchange of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files from hand to hand. </seg>
<seg id="353"> Around 200 000 transactions have already been registered with 15,000 computers on the network. </seg>
<seg id="354"> A few thousand Web sites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> The bitcoin, having reached a peak of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2, five months later, before returning today around a dozen $(courses are listed on the site bitcoincharts. com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> Nothing very impressive, compared to the global trade in real currency or in financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> However, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October. </seg>
<seg id="358"> Bitcoin described it as “the virtual currency with the most success,” “in competition with the dollar or the euro” and “similar to conventional currencies.” </seg>
<seg id="359"> Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currency as the “credits”, used to move in a video game wins by playing or that we can buy (and sometimes exchange in return). </seg>
<seg id="360"> The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> But, each time, a central authority and control trafficking trade. </seg>
<seg id="362"> Bitcoin, with all the nodes of the network are both trustees of the Book of accounts, auditors, issuers of currency, and buyers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How this network? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Each transaction between two users are in fact done between two electronic addresses in the manner of an e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, ensuring anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> A set of information relating to this transaction is electronically signed by a system of encryption key to double. </seg>
<seg id="367"> The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoins traded exist in the book of public accounts, disseminated throughout the network. </seg>
<seg id="369"> The key step is to write this new transaction in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> It depends on the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers, and that the winner, sort of central banker provisional, have the privilege to add this additional line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> It is a phase of hachage database, which is processing a large file in a digital footprint shorter and unique. </seg>
<seg id="372"> The computers “take” the new transaction, and he added a number of “grinding” before the whole. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The aim is to find the number which gives a hallmark (a lot of zeros at the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="374"> Once that number is reached, the other nodes easily check that this is the right. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The transaction is then indestructiblement linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the footprint. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If, to cheat, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than 10 minutes), one of the two transactions would be validated by the network – the other remaining orphan because the two have different fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer have solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins. </seg>
<seg id="378"> To avoid inflation, this award is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The number of bitcoins in circulation is limited to 21 million, but they are divisible until the 100 millionth, which leaves the room … </seg>
<seg id="380"> The difficulty of the challenge is also raised to each increase in the power of calculation. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The network has had ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and the bitcoins in deposits stolen. </seg>
<seg id="383"> “The flaw used is not the protocol itself”, said Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a company of payment in real currency using the network Bitcoin. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The ECB is also the possibilities of laundering money through this service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> But the cash has also this defect. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Players of weight as Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Others, such as the blogging platform WordPress, accept them. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, have analysed the book of accounts and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins does not flow. </seg>
<seg id="389"> In November, sales of “giants” were launched. </seg>
<seg id="390"> “Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” welcomes Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts of bitcoins into gold. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre Noizat, also the author of a book on teaching this currency, believes the potential of this technology as a network of transactions. </seg>
<seg id="392"> His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or a payment by mobile without contact, but it uses to validate the Bitcoin transactions, which are also cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="393"> The carrier manages its identity and can therefore be anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system is easy to implement in the merchants, who do not need to install new hardware or software. </seg>
<seg id="395"> They only need to communicate an address that a phone can “photographed and recognise,” says Pierre Noizat, having thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There is a movement called into question hierarchical systems for systems more horizontal. </seg>
<seg id="397"> “It will take time for Bitcoin is required, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicted. </seg>
<seg id="398"> The ECB, in its report, also provides for the reassessment of varying risk, today considered high, in case of success of this currency. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We left Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> And after? </seg>
<seg id="401"> French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi). </seg>
<seg id="402"> NATO and the Americans should follow end 2014. </seg>
<seg id="403"> It is time that the Afghan army takes possession of its territory and that the Afghans choose their future, without any wait for us. </seg>
<seg id="404"> It is the Afghan farmers that we have punished as terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="405"> And we, with our 88 soldiers killed, injured, and maimed. </seg>
<seg id="406"> The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former leaders refugees in Pakistan, but often of peasants who refuse the foreign military presence, such as the time of the Soviets. </seg>
<seg id="407"> They want to defend their traditions, old and archaic, even if they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks. </seg>
<seg id="408"> Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, they no longer be when westerners are more discreet. </seg>
<seg id="409"> The departure of french troops on the basis of Nijrab, I have observed the high hills planted with almond trees through appropriations french, was in order. </seg>
<seg id="410"> The convoys of trucks and armoured joined Kabul without being attacked, overflown by helicopters. </seg>
<seg id="411"> There will be no flood of Taliban in Kabul by the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Circumstances have changed since their irresistible breakthrough from 1994 to 1996. </seg>
<seg id="413"> Kabul was empty, the country ablaze because of infighting between different factions. </seg>
<seg id="414"> They seized control of the country had been seen as a kind of liberation, a return to the security. </seg>
<seg id="415"> The Afghan paid the price of obscurantism of these farmers have been overtaken by the organisation of al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved. </seg>
<seg id="416"> Former mujaheddin, Afghan government and current Taliban are united in the desire to keep women in an inferior position. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The most notable of the anti-soviet war have returned to power in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="418"> They are enraged by profiteers, seizing land government to sell them in land to build the refugees returned from Iran and Pakistan, with “huge contracts american subcontracting. </seg>
<seg id="419"> They are déconsidérés; most of them have not fought themselves. </seg>
<seg id="420"> People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many young people want to leave, and leave those who were able to take advantage of american largesse: capital flight is considerable. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Young people are tired of the war and its ideologies. </seg>
<seg id="423"> They have flirted with the modern world in their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they have appreciated the benefits. </seg>
<seg id="424"> Approximately 65% of the population is under 25 years old; Kabul now has 5 million, a fifth of the total population. </seg>
<seg id="425"> In the cities, the government schools are full, girls as boys. </seg>
<seg id="426"> It will provide work for those young people who do want more return to obscurantism of the old parties nor the corruption of leaders. </seg>
<seg id="427"> All, including the armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones, television, and its turkish soap operas that have a modern world, is followed everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="428"> The army is now presents. </seg>
<seg id="429"> The authorities that the commission will be regarded as legitimate? </seg>
<seg id="430"> The former commanders of the anti-soviet fight care already to reconstitute the militias provincial, who dodge the central power. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, a country of mountains, the strong local identities, should enjoy a degree of decentralisation, the image of western nations, but the US wanted to turn it into a centralised state, to presidential power, abolishing the post of prime minister, which had existed since the 1964 constitution. </seg>
<seg id="432"> President Karzai does not want controls foreign, especially during the planned elections in April 2014. </seg>
<seg id="433"> But his country is, since the 1950s and already well before, dependent on foreign aid. </seg>
<seg id="434"> No industry has been challenged in road, no dam is in state, no important irrigation system is repaired. </seg>
<seg id="435"> Everything is imported; nothing happened, except for fruit and vegetables. </seg>
<seg id="436"> The priority is left to private initiative. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In a country ruined by 30 years of war, a government control on infrastructure have been necessary. </seg>
<seg id="438"> The noise was widespread that Afghanistan had huge mineral wealth. </seg>
<seg id="439"> This has only added to the feeling that the western “were there to take them over. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Without energy to treat the iron ore and copper, or means of transport for export through the mountains, not of mining. </seg>
<seg id="441"> The Chinese have already almost left the Aynak copper mine of Oh, leaving archaeologists international (funded by the World Bank) search the vast Buddhist site and remain the most important employers in the province. </seg>
<seg id="442"> The day will also that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations. </seg>
<seg id="443"> The departure of french troops was completed on 20 November. </seg>
<seg id="444"> The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of the traditional aid: high school girls, boys, Department of french university, french institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural support to the archaeological. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Since 2009, to try to “win hearts and minds” and achieve the impossible task of matching aid and offensive actions, a service of actions” including civil-military” Ministry of Defence (Cimic), deleted in 2012, has conducted, and is carried out by a small french NGOS, many work of collective interest and rehabilitation work in agricultural in dozens of mountain villages. </seg>
<seg id="446"> These works, efficient workforce “force, could help to contain the insurgency: irrigation wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase of farmland. </seg>
<seg id="447"> Let us remember that as, after two billion euros of military spending? </seg>
<seg id="448"> A budget far more modest help to improve living conditions for local, very hard in these valleys often located in more than 2,000 metres. </seg>
<seg id="449"> The embassy has received dozens of requests written small agricultural achievements from local communities in the province of Kapisa. </seg>
<seg id="450"> For that they will release the insurgency led by foreign groups, that the farmers told me, it should keep in their favour a small civilian aid, well controlled and that affects them directly. </seg>
<seg id="451"> A constitution steamrollered through Egypt </seg>
<seg id="452"> This is a new gamble of President Mohammed Morsi. </seg>
<seg id="453"> While Egypt is more divided than ever about the constitutional declaration, which gives it temporarily full powers, he decided to play everything. </seg>
<seg id="454"> Took everybody by surprise, he announced Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly approves his final text the following day. </seg>
<seg id="455"> Just a week ago, the head of state had granted two additional months to this House to finish its work. </seg>
<seg id="456"> Nearly two years ago that Egypt is based on a provisional text, repeatedly amended which weakens the institutional stability and led to legal entanglements. </seg>
<seg id="457"> This new initiative has only increased the divide in the country. </seg>
<seg id="458"> For his opponents, the President is continuing with its autocratic “madness”, continuing to betray its “floor” and “trampling the law.” </seg>
<seg id="459"> The side of its supporters, is that it is a means to end soon with the institutional and political crisis, speeding up the process of transition. </seg>
<seg id="460"> A referendum should be held in the 15 days. </seg>
<seg id="461"> A very short space of time which obliges the brothers to renounce their project to explain the text, article by article, the Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="462"> For the President, it is also a way to regain a popular and democratic legitimacy while protests raged throughout the country. </seg>
<seg id="463"> Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians vote in favour, as he said in an interview with the weekly US time. </seg>
<seg id="464"> So much so that a hasty vote takes the ultimatum to the egyptian people: “either you vote for my text, I retain full powers”, supposedly to end after the adoption of the Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="465"> It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the constituent assembly, large islamist majority, voted the text yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Most liberals were missing from the appeal. </seg>
<seg id="467"> In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, believing could not assert their views. </seg>
<seg id="468"> The representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done likewise. </seg>
<seg id="469"> So that the quorum is reached, 11 people, members of replacements, have been added to the rush, yesterday morning. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="471"> Unsurprisingly, it is most often unanimously that the articles were adopted. </seg>
<seg id="472"> Commentators have also amused that one of the only differences of the day has spoken … around the time of prayer, some members of the committee felt that the pendulum of the constituent was wrong. </seg>
<seg id="473"> The text, which was still “be voted yesterday evening, contains 234 articles. </seg>
<seg id="474"> Objects of attention, Article 2 finally is identical to that of the 1971 constitution, stating that “the principles of sharia are the main source of law.” </seg>
<seg id="475"> The Salafi parties, for which the “establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hope to replace “principles” by “rules”, which would have allowed stricter application. </seg>
<seg id="476"> For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a measure of their goodwill and their respect for the other components of egyptian society. </seg>
<seg id="477"> “Hypocrisie”, meet the liberals, who see it as a blow for communication. </seg>
<seg id="478"> Because to them the Islamisation of the Constitution is through other articles. </seg>
<seg id="479"> They include Article 220, which gives the university Al Azhar an advisory role, particularly in regard to verify compliance with sharia law. </seg>

<seg id="587"> When the members and human rights activists polémiquent on what will give the law on the mandatory language test, fraudsters selling “false” certificates have already made their appearance in the country </seg>
<seg id="588"> Each year, 13 million migrant workers coming to Moscow, St Petersburg and other russian cities. </seg>
<seg id="589"> Most of the time, these are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. </seg>
<seg id="590"> Their only purpose: to earn money to help their families remained in the house. </seg>
<seg id="591"> From 1 December, a law came into force and stipulates that every migrant worker will have to pass an examination of Russian. </seg>
<seg id="592"> For the moment, this rule is that those who intend to work in the services sector, housing, personal services and retail. </seg>
<seg id="593"> However, with time, promises the federal migration service, the tests will become mandatory for all immigrants. </seg>

<seg id="601"> This initiative to introduce exams was supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Service of migration. </seg>
<seg id="602"> But, before the law came into force, the human rights defenders have repeatedly asked the question in the press: what it will give? </seg>
<seg id="603"> What is the obligation to know the russian change for the Russians and immigrants? </seg>
<seg id="604"> First of all, to meet representatives of the migration service, it will reduce the number of people suffering from “slave labour”. </seg>
<seg id="605"> Many speak of defending the rights of migrant workers, says the director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev. </seg>
<seg id="606"> The protection of rights must start before their departure. </seg>
<seg id="607"> Only a selection system organised will solve the problems at 90% foreign labourers. </seg>
<seg id="608"> The problems arise for immigrants without work, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates. </seg>
<seg id="609"> Without the understanding of the language, certifies Sebelev, future migrant is designed to meet some dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, provide a “journey” in a crowded maisonnette where he and dozens of his ilk are tourmenteront for months without food and without paper and toiling between 12 and 14 hours a day. </seg>
<seg id="610"> We receive many complaints from our migrants. </seg>

<seg id="613"> However, many residents of the republics of Central Asia who want to earn money in Russia confiding that they are not only the language of the country where they want to travel, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language. </seg>
<seg id="614"> This of course is not their fault, but their misery: little, Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow a primary education passable. </seg>
<seg id="615"> Indeed, their families do not even have to feed their children without talking about the dress properly and to equip them for the school. </seg>
<seg id="616"> As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people are moving to earn money when the opportunity arises. </seg>
<seg id="617"> It is difficult when you do not know the language, nannies. </seg>
<seg id="618"> “Do you feel diminished and diminished.” </seg>
<seg id="619"> The human rights defenders, psychologists, however, one important aspect of the law on the language. </seg>
<seg id="620"> The reviews are intended solely to migrants who have a legal status. </seg>
<seg id="621"> Without status, there is no review or official work afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="622"> However, most of the migrant workers continue to live in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="623"> “Welcome to enter or defence” </seg>
<seg id="624"> Many immigrants explains that it is not so easy to get official status in Russia. </seg>

<seg id="634"> Of course, their new owners have not had for nothing: each migrant who hoped to facilitate the task of the examinations had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document. </seg>
<seg id="635"> It is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles. </seg>
<seg id="636"> Representatives of power and human rights defenders, agrees that the short-term objective is to protect the system against corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these “bits of paper.” </seg>
<seg id="637"> The authorities can give to migrant workers who have not been able to validate the examination of the first time to follow the language. </seg>

<seg id="721"> According to official data from the Ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of these crimes has generally fallen in Russia of 7% and amounts to 22,9 miles while confirmed cases of theft and extortion, weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs dropped by 7.8%. </seg>
<seg id="722"> United States: employees of fast-food outlets and supermarkets are on strike </seg>
<seg id="723"> Almost a quarter of american teenagers spend by a cashier at McDonald&apos;s </seg>
<seg id="724"> In recent days, a wave of protests against low wages rise is charged by the supermarket Walmart and famous fast-food chains such as McDonald&apos;s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy and Kentucky Fried Chicken. </seg>
<seg id="725"> For the moment, no one can predict if this wave will take the scale or steam quickly. </seg>
<seg id="726"> These actions are supported by unions and a number of associations left. </seg>
<seg id="727"> Alongside the modest wage increases that employees receive basic home and Walmart in the fast-food chains, organisers of demonstrations to the creation of unions. </seg>
<seg id="728"> This sector is currently not covered by the trade union movement. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 cents per year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The protests began last week after thanksgiving, the “black Friday”, when a rain flood of balances seizing millions of people in America and triggering sometimes esclandres. </seg>
<seg id="731"> That day, some employees of the company, which employs Walmart worldwide 2.2 million people, have left their posts to organise picket lines with the trade unions and left-wing activists in the shops of the company whose products are intended for consumers of modest and middle classes. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walmart sold everything: layers of hunting rifles through the car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> The products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in the major supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> That is why many poorly paid workers at Walmart shopping solely on their place of work. </seg>
<seg id="735"> The price and the choice of products made from Walmart, one of the most powerful groups in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="736"> According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its products cheap partly because of low wages to its employees. </seg>
<seg id="737"> They also complain about the difficult working conditions, for example the lack of forklift trucks or portable scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> The participants of the demonstrations of “black Friday” demanded a pay increase, they complained about the fact that the cost of medical insurance provided by the company had risen from 30 to 100 dollars per month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> To the employee base among Walmart, which affects $9.5 hour, it is a sum that it cannot afford. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Scientists from the University of California at Berkley show that if Walmart increased the average salary at $12 an hour, this will cost the group $3.2 billion. </seg>
<seg id="741"> This is 1.1% more of what it currently spending. </seg>
<seg id="742"> If Walmart transferred any wage increases on consumers, every race in the shop they amount to 46 cents. </seg>
<seg id="743"> They spend in a year only 12,39 dollars more than now. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Supporters of Walmart note with satisfaction that the protests have taken place in only nine states and have brought no injury to the group. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The “black Friday” has continued in the shops of 8h the evening at midnight the next day and Walmart has sold on this period 5,000 articles to the second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Its banks have done in every 100 million transactions for the “black Friday”. </seg>
<seg id="747"> The spokesman of the society Dan Fogleman said in an interview with the Huffington Post website left that “less than five” employees of Walmart had left their posts and that the protest was a “operation com” among many” from the trade union organizer. </seg>
<seg id="748"> “Client next!” </seg>
<seg id="749"> The protests have continued this week in New York and were not more shops Walmart (progressive in this city, they are not very popular, which is why they are not yet implanted) but the McDonald&apos;s and other restaurants cheap. </seg>
<seg id="750"> McDonald&apos;s announcement sell billions of portions and after they do give you not even leave disease and do not pay for the work that you have done honestly! </seg>
<seg id="751"> Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council of New York </seg>
<seg id="752"> Currently, the minimum wage set by the federal legislation and that of New York is $9 an hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> Fast-food outlets the increase with time, but little, on average, its employees plumbing in New York 8,90 $earlier. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Nobody affects less than them in this city. </seg>
<seg id="755"> For me it is inconceivable to live with this sum in New York. </seg>
<seg id="756"> There was a time when nearly a quarter of american teenagers working in McDonald&apos;s after school while living among their parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Few people saw their primary source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Today, I find myself interviewing employees McDonald&apos;s who complain about having to live with this salary and sometimes have to feed their children with. </seg>
<seg id="759"> Moreover, on the forum of the Wall Street Journal newspaper found the comments saying that it is irresponsible to make children if you do not know what you are going to feed them. </seg>
<seg id="760"> The protesters who launched the movement Thursday to 6h30 near the McDonald&apos;s of the 40th street on Madison Avenue and demanded that the cashiers and cooks fast-food are paid at least $15 an hour, or an increase of more than twice the minimum wage. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They also demanded that the unions in the catering sector quickly. </seg>
<seg id="762"> American law prohibits the administration to prevent and punish the protesters of a union by bullying or redundancies. </seg>
<seg id="763"> However, the administration rarely simplifies their lives. </seg>
<seg id="764"> For a syndicate, grabbing fast food remains a difficult task, and that, for practical reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> One of the biggest is the extraordinary turnover of staff. </seg>
<seg id="766"> They are not in agreement </seg>
<seg id="767"> Other demonstrations were held tumultuous near several other fast-food chains. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The flagship of the protest has been gathering in the middle of the day near the McDonald&apos;s Times Square with the intervention of several political local Democrats, particularly that of Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council, who said: “McDonald&apos;s announcement sell billions of portions and after they do give you not even leave disease and do not pay for the work that you have done honestly!”. </seg>
<seg id="769"> The demonstrators were supported by other Democrats in New York, particularly by the candidate for the post of mayor Bill De Blasio who said that “we must all support the employees of fast food so that they get a fair pay and economic well-being that deserves every New Yorkers. </seg>
<seg id="770"> The New York Times has characterized the protest as the biggest ever of the catering sector early in its history. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But only a few hundred people participated and that all were not employees of fast-food, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York. </seg>
<seg id="772"> It is difficult to say if this will spark a mass movement of small. </seg>
<seg id="773"> “For the moment it is moderately to fool the brain” </seg>
<seg id="774"> Lately, fans of the new technologies are used to collect the augmented reality through special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> At the outset, it is Google, which unveiled this summer its current model at its annual conference and in November it was reported that Microsoft had made the request of the patent. </seg>
<seg id="776"> However, it is clear from the conversation with the director of the interactive 3d technologies of Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for scientists in this society, the glasses are already history. </seg>
<seg id="777"> They are tempted by the prospect of manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual open spaces. </seg>
<seg id="778"> Could you tell us in a few words what your research group? </seg>
<seg id="779"> We are working on the interaction between man and machine, and at the same time we are trying to expand the borders of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> The humanity as a whole remained for the moment the pixels on a screen flat and sometimes the tactile. </seg>
<seg id="781"> We want to look five to 10 years before and we guess the radical changes that occur with this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the games console Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and virtually no Xbox can sell today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the order by the gesture. </seg>
<seg id="783"> We also reserve the future? </seg>
<seg id="784"> Although the Kinect has delivered the physical interaction, lots of things are happening on screen dish, sometimes in 3d. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The seizure of the information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the yield, for the moment, not really. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change that and we are working on systems of 3d imaging really operating on different technologies, including technologies projection. </seg>
<seg id="787"> We must get the computer world in ours, in the physical world, the more tactile. </seg>
<seg id="788"> For that, however, we must identify not only the user, but also the space surrounding it. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Thus, we can complement the real world by objects in a virtual form more practical. </seg>
<seg id="790"> First, we should dismiss these stupid helmets of virtual reality! </seg>
<seg id="791"> – What do you think of the voice command? </seg>
<seg id="792"> It is appreciated, but is it not overrated? </seg>
<seg id="793"> We cannot say that this is a panacea: the issue of confidentiality arises because we did not always want to inform others of his actions or his intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, every type of interaction with the computer is good, but everyone in its niche. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, to command the equipment in public places, we had a project for which we thought to gestures, not broad gestures, but rather to gestures discreet, restricted. </seg>
<seg id="796"> The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a police brought to the hand that recorded the movements of bones and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="797"> Currently it is great, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a show. </seg>
<seg id="798"> In fact, the future will be marked by the Joint Command, for example: gesture + voice. </seg>
<seg id="799"> That is to say? </seg>
<seg id="800"> For example, how would you ask me you can get this? </seg>
<seg id="801"> You would do with the words and gestures. </seg>
<seg id="802"> - Usually I speak only. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - Oh, it will be difficult to recognize. </seg>
<seg id="804"> So, you want to force users to adapt according to what the machine can or not done at a given moment? </seg>
<seg id="805"> Not necessarily, but it is a rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think that very soon we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that enable us to better identify the reactions of the man. </seg>
<seg id="807"> It may be, for example, laser sensors, they produce a good enough resolution in depth, and that is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> If you are interested in your work on the Xbox Kinect sensors, what is it that you do not like in the modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> They lack of resolution, depth or something else? </seg>
<seg id="810"> In principle, it is on the current generation that we base our work on the recognition 3d. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, it would be good to get around 8 mégapixels with a speed of 1000 / it is. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But the problem is not the mégapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> On this last point, all current technologies are quite good, this adds to the labour designers algorithms. </seg>
<seg id="814"> We must keep in mind the resolution in the axes X and Y, but also Z. </seg>
<seg id="815"> The speed is too much, the number of managers in the second. </seg>
<seg id="816"> The movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 / it is really not enough, especially for the gestures. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Steven Bathiche, our laboratory Redmond has given the touch sensor a delay regular treatment between 1 and 100, the current µs sensors being closer to the second value (60-100). </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction of man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="819"> I have a system of this type in my work, but not requiring, for most of the second. </seg>
<seg id="820"> But it is not, increase the number of cameras? </seg>
<seg id="821"> The Kinect has today three “cameras”, which is in fact an infrared emitter and the receiver of the signal, a second thought. </seg>
<seg id="822"> And the third is in fact a camera sensor&apos;s usual immediately visible. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It is not used to determine the depth of the subject. </seg>
<seg id="824"> Many cameras could solve this problem … </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or worse by increasing the volume of calculations required. </seg>
<seg id="826"> It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, to play with the curve of cameras and to see how it could help determine the locations. </seg>
<seg id="827"> As I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not submitted his glasses in public. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Do you not think that, from the point of view of the daily use of technology, the augmented reality glasses are one of the platforms with the most prospects? </seg>
<seg id="829"> Of course, walk around all the time with a smart phone the hands is not practical, but what I think: the best option would be a reality increased “transitional” which you would from a cloud platform to move glasses in smart phone. </seg>
<seg id="830"> The glasses are a very personal and that makes their force (the personal elements are those that you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: the augmented reality from the glasses do not allow you to work on the virtual objects in collaboration with other people. </seg>
<seg id="831"> - Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of holographiques virtual objects in the air is no longer accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also the mere mortal. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is a problem on which the opponents of this idea are pointing the finger: there is no tactile sensation! </seg>
<seg id="833"> The hands do not feel nothing! </seg>
<seg id="834"> What answers your group preparing it compared to this challenge? </seg>
<seg id="835"> In my way, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations. </seg>
<seg id="837"> For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand for support of image. </seg>
<seg id="838"> It is perfectly the pressure! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there is also the technologies that are really designed to assign the palpabilité to these “pictures in the air”: for example the interference of several shelves ultrasound led to a point where the finger and which gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, a breath of air on the ends of the fingers. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There is also the bracelets worn on poignets that affect nerve endings of fingers, they are also a line of work with prospects. </seg>
<seg id="841"> And have you tried to fool the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> Make him believe that he feels that he should normally feel when he sees something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> That was a good idea, we have not yet tried. </seg>
<seg id="844"> There is still a task here below on which we still have long to give the evil: how to pretend to someone who is physically in a very small area that it works in an open area almost infinite-we are working on the concepts of carpets of race (nothing to do with those found in the clubs of fitness), mobile platforms and also the giant baubles. </seg>
<seg id="845"> For the moment, is moderately to fool the brain, there are still many years of work. </seg>
<seg id="846"> That is what makes the work on the virtual reality if interesting for the researcher: many things are still in a state of absolute fertilization. </seg>
<seg id="847"> The reign of taste and not the culture-Rosbalt UK. </seg>
<seg id="848"> “Rosbalt” continues the project “the vanguard Petersburg” dedicated to urban dwellers who are in advance, at the vanguard of culture and art. </seg>
<seg id="849"> This list ultra-selective has already hosted prominent actors artistic St Petersburg whose achievements are beyond the borders of the city and have found a recognition in Europe, having been known throughout Russia. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new hero of “Rosbalt” is the painter extraverti Kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The whole town knows Kirill Miller, this man, bearded, dressed in red that you can sit near the Russian Museum Garden, the summer or in the festivities and vernissages plugged. </seg>
<seg id="852"> The tables of Kirill Miller still rallying crowds, whatever their exposure. </seg>
<seg id="853"> It is one of conteurs pétersbourgeois fundamentally social and philosophical, one of the founders of the new myths. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller is an eminent representative of the vanguard Petersburg of the late 1980s and early 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> It is also the symbol of the city, his appearance made people smile and puts in a good mood. </seg>
<seg id="856"> It has recently taken in his hands a culmination of Barbary and it became the symbol of this instrument to St Petersburg since it had matured enough for this difficult role of its existence, its philosophy and its image of bohémien. </seg>
<seg id="857"> - Kirill, why are you through the city while not in red and yellow or blue turquoise, for example? </seg>
<seg id="858"> I chose the red as clothing firm specialising in aspect and image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world, the red is a compromise between the painter, the creator of image and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> Even if in the society, which is not grey raises the aggressiveness and a negative unrest. </seg>
<seg id="861"> But my provocations are designed to initiate the discussion. </seg>
<seg id="862"> The whole history of my actions provocative is an invitation to the debate. </seg>
<seg id="863"> And when did you understood that you had to be painter? </seg>
<seg id="864"> The exposure of the Palace of Culture Nevskiy where were my work. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I understood that this was my way. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then, the wave of old painters unofficial was gone and the new, free, like me, were misunderstood. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I started at my friends with painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina which gave birth to “Pouchinskaya-10” and then there has been more vague. </seg>
<seg id="868"> I am interested in the theatre, fashion, music, all the Equality except for the words. </seg>
<seg id="869"> And all this is in your clinical artistic … it was important for me to be at the centre of the culture of St Petersburg where must meet the best creative forces. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995, I have taken place at Pouchkinskaya-10 which housed the work before a club musical and artistic, a club bohémien, the home of Bohemia Petersburg. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many are born: NOM, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arrive with the project “the ear of Van Gogh.” </seg>
<seg id="872"> Chnour and his friends sang songs easy in play-back in swimming moulants, they were among them, composer Igor Vdovin today. </seg>
<seg id="873"> When the group began to happen in Live, it became “Leningrad”. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Trakhtenberg infused not emissions before the time of Hali Gali. </seg>
<seg id="875"> We have given them Trakhtenberg and then his great career began, but his training and his basic education, it is at home that he has received. </seg>
<seg id="876"> “Galérie D137 Club”, “Griboïedov”: these are the repercussions of the artistic clinic. </seg>
<seg id="877"> Our employees are parties as accustomed. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I am a hero of the past century, when the culture wanted to say something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In 2000, a poll was organised in the press: it was the price “personalities of our city.” </seg>
<seg id="880"> I have been appointed “artist of the year”, and that is when my reign was ended. </seg>
<seg id="881"> This is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and the culture of the past century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> Today, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, we may be popular, but not really a person of culture. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - Your work is characterised by a recognisable style. </seg>
<seg id="884"> Many of my tables are hits, they have a situation and a very strong. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I will have an exhibition scheduled “the museum through the russian clowns.” </seg>
<seg id="886"> The clowns belong to a category timeless. </seg>
<seg id="887"> Before I was a social, today it hurts and that fear of being so. </seg>
<seg id="888"> But with the clowns, receding, the tragic fall. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love the grotesque, I have ideas grotesque. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, the idea of saving the world via the nakedly total and compulsory. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Today, it is the dress that is important, it is interested in the mechanism outside, but not in person. </seg>
<seg id="892"> Perhaps we could not give him the hand, but rather to spit the tronche. </seg>
<seg id="893"> And the lie will be wiped out by the nakedly. </seg>
<seg id="894"> Recently we will have seen in the role of player culmination of Barbary. - a city cultural must have this kind of hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who else can play. </seg>
<seg id="896"> But perhaps the art trade can also be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> Today the art trade must be treated, delicate liquoreux. </seg>
<seg id="898"> A disintegration of the culture is happening. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Before, people were divided in herds, supporters of Bohemia loved something dumb, another. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is hard to please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I am not a ticket for a hundred dollars to please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Today, we need to think about who you please. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Each star has 100 fans. </seg>
<seg id="904"> But thousands of people come see Stas Mikhaïlov! </seg>
<seg id="905"> What are people that we have thrown who come to see, is the sexual and social work. </seg>
<seg id="906"> But for the cultural side, 300 people come, 10 miles will not, and ultimately that is less management, money, just languishes. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil the experience. </seg>
<seg id="908"> When I was young, I peignais tables a collectionneur has hung alongside Falk or Larionov. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with the tables which usually are those that are painted in end of life. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Today, we often confuse the ideas. </seg>
<seg id="911"> We say: there is the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption. </seg>
<seg id="912"> The consumer culture, it has nothing to do. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused the money just to paint. </seg>
<seg id="914"> I am to this culture. </seg>
<seg id="915"> - Kirill, what is lacking in St Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="916"> - Good experts. </seg>
<seg id="917"> It is this concept: the official culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But all may not work in the culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> During the reign of the Tsars, this was not like that, the tsars did not understand the culture, but they understood that it needed to retain the good experts. </seg>
<seg id="920"> In Moscow, there is now good consultants. </seg>
<seg id="921"> We have people here in St Petersburg who could be experts, but they are discarded, because experts higher which accurately assess these experts and their fraieront a path. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Currently, it is the “reign of taste evolves.” </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same Erarta, but they differ in that they say honestly that they do not take all contemporary art, there are painters who must find other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> For you, what is St Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="925"> St Petersburg-is not the cultural capital, there is much more to Moscow of culture, there is a ground for this. </seg>
<seg id="926"> And on our stones, art is hard to push. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, that is bad. </seg>
<seg id="928"> In Europe, there is a lot of curious who will see exhibitions, concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> At home, this layer is very fine. </seg>
<seg id="930"> We must make the art to fashion, as was the case at the beginning of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> Project done with the support of the stock of St Petersburg </seg>
<seg id="932"> Giving birth in space </seg>
<seg id="933"> The Earth is in danger. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Warming or collision with an asteroid murderer. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Caravans of space shuttles with land to go in search of a planet of rescue. </seg>
<seg id="936"> To save humanity, a big question is: how can we continue to live our species in weightlessness or even on a planet of rescue? </seg>
<seg id="937"> I believe that there is not much choice. </seg>
<seg id="938"> There are in fact two real planets that we can win, if only by hypothesis. </seg>
<seg id="939"> “It is about Venus and Mars,” believes Vladimir Sourdine, researcher from the Institute of State astronomical P.K. Chternberg (GAICh). </seg>
<seg id="940"> If on Mars conditions are more suited for life, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500. </seg>
<seg id="941"> We cannot live there at very high altitude or on the orbit of Venus … in space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> We began to take an interest in matters of reproduction in space by focusing on flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> There was still a half-century, carried out experiments on the plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> Four generations of peas grown on orbit is differentiated in no way varieties of land. </seg>
<seg id="945"> Secondly, it has put into orbit of insects, small flies drosophiles milking. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979, quail eggs were sent to the area to see how a developing embryo in weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="947"> You get to the exit a poussin quite normal. </seg>
<seg id="948"> It is then that the problems start. </seg>
<seg id="949"> “The problem is that the poussin must find a medium, he must get on its feet and start moving,” explains the director of the institute of forensic biological problems of the Academy of Sciences of Russia (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="950"> By not finding any medium, the chicks are waving disorderly. </seg>
<seg id="951"> And after 10 p. m., the new born saw their instincts entirely atrophying. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The chicks will react to or the light or at her. </seg>
<seg id="953"> Unfortunately, they simply die after quattre days. </seg>
<seg id="954"> “We have widened their eyes twice, then we have abandoned, because it is simply impossible to work with them there,” explains Vladimir Sychev in noting the failure of the experience with the chicks in space. </seg>
<seg id="955"> The last “miniature ark” organic with animals has been sent into orbit 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> The experiments will continue in spring 2013. </seg>
<seg id="957"> However, the “biosatellite Bion” take on board that the species of the same sex. </seg>
<seg id="958"> There has been an experience with rats sent with their fetus in space. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, there is nothing supernatural being discovered. </seg>
<seg id="960"> “It was still biosatellites and then it is the only experience to carry out this kind of research,” said Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After landing, the rats in the area have given birth to their offspring. </seg>
<seg id="962"> However, we cannot yet make reproductions directly in space. </seg>
<seg id="963"> This is no small feat. </seg>
<seg id="964"> By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realise their sexual impulses. </seg>
<seg id="965"> Unlike animals, humans can, in principle. </seg>
<seg id="966"> The Homo sapiens has abstract, it is able to create a proper emotional content. </seg>
<seg id="967"> This kind of experience is not done for ethical reasons. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But women are in the area for 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova. </seg>
<seg id="970"> And the female body is what humanity has more valuable. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our mouette has disappeared and nobody on Earth could not say whether it would take after a flight into space. </seg>
<seg id="972"> If she could give birth to a child after the theft. </seg>
<seg id="973"> “Nobody answering this question,” explains Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, pensioner sector rockets and space. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, just a year after his flight in space, the first woman, Valentina Tereshkova – gave birth to a girl. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The father of the child, Andrian Nikolaïev was also –. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, the second woman – Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been twice on orbit and having worked in middle non-working, gave birth to a son. </seg>
<seg id="977"> However, the risk continues. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We have very little, even little spaceflight who did nothing and who give birth to a descent into full health after long flights. </seg>
<seg id="979"> “And if they are longer, this presents a danger even during flights into orbit,” concludes the pilot – and, hero of the Soviet Union and heroes of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov. </seg>
<seg id="980"> But humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, protection against radiation and the creation of an artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="981"> Laboratory of hydrology of central preparation of spaceflight: obligatory step in preparation for the flight. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here, in flottabilité zero, spaceflight has lead to exit non-véhiculaires. </seg>
<seg id="983"> Water imitates the weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> If for adults, water is comfortable but a middle abroad, for infants, it is their true element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> The small amphibious men seem to confirm: life on Earth from the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> As the baby moving around 9 months in the liquid lymphatique the belly of its mother, it is easier to get used to the water. </seg>
<seg id="987"> This is, in principle, logical, since its birth until his first bath, it happens only 2 weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> “It is very unlikely to forget,” explains the instructor swimmer for infants, Marina Aksenova. </seg>
<seg id="989"> In a word, whether for the child who just born the weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs of gravity, a force of weight. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In weightlessness, the muscles in the womb, the basin is atrophient very quickly, the ability to push the baby is lost. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Good to know that agreement, based on simulators childbirth. </seg>
<seg id="992"> Of course you can prepare a birth in a special chamber, the woman will bring it out. </seg>
<seg id="993"> “And then?” asks Valeriy Poliakov to invite to reflect on this complex issue. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand, the child also needs an artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> If he does not feel the soft ground, the body does not form the skeleton or the muscle system. </seg>
<seg id="996"> We cannot pay a baby as an adult with a combination of special for the exercises. </seg>
<seg id="997"> It will simply be deprived of its vital needs. </seg>
<seg id="998"> “And this experience that we see in this case in imagining the birth of a child in a strange environment will return to Earth of a disabled child, entirely désadapté”, says the director of the ethics committee in the Institute of forensic biological problems of the Academy of Sciences of Russia, Igor Pestov. </seg>
<seg id="999"> The birth of children in the area is still theory. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> However, with time this will become reality, when the people travelling in their commuting to a distant planet, which will become the habitat of their offspring born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> The head of the ISC (institution more control of public finances) said: “the control of pseudo-independent work (in Czech” system Švarc”) failed because of politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> In the area of government procurement, the Czech Republic has trained inspectors and legislation of quality but it is lagging behind in its application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> That is what was said Miloslav Kala, Vice President of the institution more control of public finances in an interview for Aktuálně. cz. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> “The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, that is what is missing here,” said Kala in his explanation of the current situation. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> An inspection conducted jointly by inspectors czech and german also suggests similar conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> He cites as an example of abusive practice approach of the “system” by Petr Nečas Švarc. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> The first minister said recently that the ODS would not upset the entrepreneurs with controls; is permitted or prohibited? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> “The law must be applied in one way or another, even if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent act one authority to inspect to demand respect for the law,” says Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At the meeting of the supervisory committee in the House of Deputies, you mentioned a Czech-german project in which have been compared to the laws of procurement of these two countries. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What was it actually matter? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> There is a parallel control that we have launched about two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> In simple terms, the european legislation provides for how to manage the public markets and national legislation and a special practice itself will follow. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> We have brought all this and that this procedure is not yet complete, we are very interesting differences emerged: generally speaking, our legislation may be “stronger and better”, however, certain parameters, such as the practice is best in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> This confirms that it does not do enough to continually develop rules increasingly detailed but that it is necessary to devote themselves to the implementation of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> What this project can help you specifically and result in it for you? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> A joint control of this type should contribute to that we stop to try to clarify the laws, lowering and improve the thresholds, when this was not a really positive effect. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), to exclude all enrichment and a possible criminal activity. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But by lowering thresholds of markets, you will not necessarily this objective. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> It could be that this system is so overwhelmed by paperwork, that those who seek loopholes will find many more opportunities if the threshold was remained high. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> You talk about internal problems concerning the implementation of the legislation of the public markets. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> How the control system in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Is there a similar institution in our ISC or a mode of organisation different? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> For those institutions, similarly to the ISC, works there the Bundesrechnungshof which is organized similarly, it also has a board was a little differently, but these two institutions are basically in a similar manner. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> The powers are also, to a certain extent, similar, with nuance, however, compared to our system: Germany being a federal structure, it has also over the accounts of this kind at the level of individual states. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> The BRH can only control the federal money, which is home to the resources of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> The public funds managed by the regions and municipalities, are there controlled level over the accounts of the Länder. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> As regards the national legislation, is simpler than ours? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> I do not wish to make general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, Germany is often cited as a model but we can certainly do better in all areas. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> It may be due to the fact that they have better inspectors? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> Not, certainly, but I repeat, I do not have data for comparison. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> However, it must also be said that this country that we regard as a model is also facing a whole series of problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise, they have no advantage to cooperate with our institution, no? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> As regards the national legislation, that has meant for you, as an institution, the amendment of the law on public markets, its effects are already feel? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> This amendment being entered into force relatively recently, it has no impact on our control operations. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> As we do the controls, it is with some delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> Our observations only concern, for the moment, the process of preparing future controls-we have launched a new instrument of “detection of risk of bad management” with which we have previously screened nearly 14 000 public markets, these changes will, of course, because the thresholds have been modified so that the conditions of some types of tendering procedures and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> Is this so that you consider the adoption of this law rather than as an advantage or as an additional burden for the administration? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think that this law is a step in the right direction, and I hope that the future will confirm this. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> The problem that can arise is that these rules are becoming more severe and that it is not possible to meet them. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> Already under the regime of the previous regulation, the provider (for example, the regional council, in the case of the regional operational programmes) recruited subjects monitored to accept that any violation of the law on the markets means a breach of discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> So is it really appropriate to make the law more severe in this way? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> No, not in that way, I think. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system has to exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse but not punish those who commit errors formal without consequence on the decision-making process. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system will put greater pressure on the administration. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> So what is the solution to cope? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Look at where we are not. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not upset the entrepreneurs with the controls of the so-called system Švarc-what does that mean? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> The system Švarc is banned or allowed? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law must be applied in one way or another, even if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent act one authority to inspect and demand respect for the law. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> He can say: “we are going to change the law and allow”, but we cannot say that we are going to act as if nothing had happened. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The law on the markets has relatively strict rules on formalities to achieve and what, precisely in order to protect the tender. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated solely because of defects. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and is, in my opinion, what is lacking at home. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> The roads are frozen in places, but most penetrable. </seg>

<seg id="1107"> What do you think of the fact that in less than a month, this should be the end of the world? </seg>
<seg id="1108"> This is just one of these alarming news, the kind of traps in which we love down. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> In our group The Tap Tap, rigole rather and we are told that we are the only group able to collect a remains positive energy in order to delay or prevent the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> Moreover, you go up in December a project quite unique: three concerts against the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> Can you offer in more detail this project to our readers? </seg>
<seg id="1112"> It is a charity that we prepare for two years. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the mayan calendar announced on 21 December 10 to 11 hours of the morning. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> The day before, on 20 December, three concerts held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> They will run almost at the point where the mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati, which is in the ocean, on a peaceful time zone in advance of 12 hours compared to us. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> That has had this idea? </seg>
<seg id="1117"> Initially I think that was my idea, then we have all designed with our creator, Honza Augusta. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want, together with the public, think about the state of the world we leave to our children. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> At the end of the mayan calendar, we have created a unique collection of objects, including shoes, t-shirts, bags, and the original key against the end of the world, buying online at www. e-tap. cz people can also support us. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The group The Tap Tap with other interpreters has also recorded an anthem against the end of the world, which is called “the end of the world (“cancelled” in Czech Konec světa zrušeno”). </seg>
<seg id="1121"> It is already very popular on YouTube, the hearing is also at these concerts charitable? </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Of course, in the end, finally, if we succeed and that the end of the world has not … </seg>
<seg id="1123"> It will be chantée simultaneously by all the performers in the three concerts. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> The anthems are also joining at a given moment in a broadcast live, quite unique, television Czech. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> The words of that song was written by Tomáš Hanák which also takes the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X is also singing … </seg>
<seg id="1126"> How are you come to cooperate with them? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> We work with other figures of show business, because we have many concerts and charity events … </seg>
<seg id="1128"> We try to make them intensively involved in these projects. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that the fun. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> What are the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> To equip the training centre Studeo which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and we are working to achieve in the framework of the Institute Jedlička, with the association Tap, and that for six years. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> Teachers are regularly pupils Institute Jedličkův and offering activities that interest them and amused. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> The students themselves do not have the means to go to the courts, we try to help them in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> As part of the completion of the construction of the Institute Jedlička we will transfer this project in a new building. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> Several groups of music and performers get on stage at each of these concerts? </seg>
<seg id="1136"> By what criteria, you have the chosen? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We have tried to develop a programme that appeals to all generations, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> For example, in Prague, set on stage Chinaski, Support Lesbiens Illustratosphere, with Dan Bárta, the Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> You can find all the details on www. kpks. cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Prepare yourself to other “mega events” of this kind in the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In May, we will play for the first time in the framework of the Prague Spring; also, surely we prepare a programme of quality with guests interesting. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> We would also like to play next year in the house of the Czech Republic to New York and personally, once in the US, I like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Your international projects are minimal, you played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The Tap Tap is nevertheless a group composed of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How do you manage the organization and logistics of your touring? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> This is not so terrible that it sounds at first. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> We have five members in electric chair whose gear must travel in bunker, naturally we trimbalons too many bags and boxes of instruments … </seg>
<seg id="1148"> So far, everything is always more or less well past ČSA and British Airways were always well prepared for us, they have surprised me more than once. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything happened without problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Thanks to your travel abroad, you can compare what these countries differ in terms of ease of access for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of the public towards disabled people and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> What have been your experiences until now? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After Luxembourg, Madrid, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow that is all that is still in the initial phase. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> In Prague, Moscow is still very few accessible to people with disabilities; there, it is still not aware that a person moves only in electric chair in the city centre. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> They do not yet see evidence to give priority to a person in a chair in a lift. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately there, too, an association seeking to draw attention to the problems of disabled people is being created. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> What do we have to catch up with the more developed countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are a lot of things for which we are still lagging behind … </seg>
<seg id="1158"> It is important to mention that the improvements and refinements are always dependent on efforts by the people involved. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a severe handicap travelling alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, the museum, anywhere … </seg>
<seg id="1160"> It is not very often where a large number of disabled people actively participate in social life, on this point, you, the Tap Tap, are rather the contrary to the cutting edge! </seg>
<seg id="1161"> The respect of the public and the access facilities are one thing, but the situation really begin to change when we have among us athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> For the moment, they are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The group The Tap Tap is currently very popular, going back a few years, which would you drove in 1998 to create this group? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> I started to work as an educator at the Institute Jedlička, where I found myself surrounded by a lot of young people willing to invest in something. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And as I am myself (I musician plays, among others, of the saxophone), with a colleague, we have created a music activity. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> And then, with time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič, has lost control of the situation (laughter). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> The success came in recent years, if I am not mistaken? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> That is true, to create links with singers known and work actively to promote the group has helped us. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> We understood that, if a job is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the fund. </seg>
<seg id="1170"> Thanks to European Union subsidies, we can, in addition, our teacher quality, equipment, and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> Had you aim to reach such a level with The Tap Tap? </seg>
<seg id="1172"> From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential to change things. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> Show business is full of tricks which copy from each other. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> In a way it is logical: everything new is accepted with caution and it takes a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1175"> Few projects are original, and I daresay that Tap Tap is one of them. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression of a person who we see for the first time the pity is, of course, that is natural … </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But the pity is completely unnecessary, because people with a disability are not in pain, abandoned of all, that we need to take in pity. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> These are people who can live a full life and flourish, provided we have the necessary resources, of course. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I often say that when people with disabilities to achieve something, this is not only a step for them but for the whole society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> Has your success is also due to the fact that you are a leader, you are demanding as described by many people? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If we want to do the work of quality, we must be firm in many areas and demand a certain discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> But I think this is quite normal. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> Some people come to us with a romantic vision and the head in the clouds and, when they realise that they must come to repeats twice per week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the roads to the concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals. </seg>
<seg id="1185"> The group The Tap Tap currently has 20 members. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> “How many of them were already there in 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1187"> A single, Láďa Angelovič. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> We are a group opened, people entering and leaving, we can do nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> Our doors are always open to those who want to have or want to join us. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> This is the eve of the day planned for the end of the world, on Thursday 20 December 2012 from 9 p. m. </seg>
<seg id="1191"> This action in Prague in the arena Incheba in Brno to Fléda and Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1192"> At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by relays visual when chantée jointly the song the group The Tap Tap “end of the world” cancelled. </seg>
<seg id="1193"> The aim of the concert is to gather the financial resources (25 million CZK) to equip the training centre multifunctional Studeo which lies in Prague in the Institute Jedlička. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, entry is free for children up to 12 years, the sales of tickets is open to Bohemiaticket. </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Poland and the cosmos. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Last week, at the meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland has been admitted as twentieth member of this agency, it is the second member of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland had begun a close collaboration with the ESA in 1994 and in the years that followed has participated in a number of projects in the agency. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> The road to Poland into space has, however, began much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Before the second world war, the polish fans are working on space flights; they do not always get understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I would like to mention, for example, the conference has Šternfeld. the astronomical observatory in Warsaw, 6 December 1933, during which he detailed ideas from his book, entitled “introduction to space travel.” </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left listeners cold and years later Šternfeld rappela is that only Dr Jan Gadomski&apos;interest in its work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> In 1934, Šternfeld earned in France the price-Robert Esnault Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his book “introduction to space travel.” </seg>
<seg id="1203"> The doctor Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) became a great propagateur of astronomy and space travel. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> It published hundreds of articles in newspapers and polish wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomski became a propagateur space travel of world renown, his contribution has been particularly rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of cratères of the dark side of the moon. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> From 1925 was built in Poland a draisine destined to be equipped with a rocket engine. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> It is unfortunately neither the author nor the details of this project. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not clear whether the rocket should serve to propel or curb the draisine. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> The only information known about the draisine are those of the press of the time. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> From 1933, the polish artillery began to devote themselves to the rockets. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The research was carried out by the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with teachers and Mieczyslaw Wolfke Gustaw Mokrzyckiego. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> The documents held that this research had reached the trial stage. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> Of course, with the arrival of the german armed, research is being discontinued. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937, plans a rocket hunting photoélectrique, designed by the engineer Rohoziński, first appeared in the press and the following year was published the book “Rakieta-torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza” of an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> These two projects had intended for military use of rocket engines. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Just before the war, all the projects to use the technical rockets were conducted by the scientific advisory committee (“provisional Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy”), which was coordinating all the work. </seg>
<seg id="1217"> This committee was created in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended his activities. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> After the war, other work on the aircraft were published in the polish press, thanks to the polish society astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="1219"> For the first time, it is a question of a society in the number of November 1954 newspaper problem, in which four more detailed articles devoted to aeronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> In one of these articles, written by Professor Mr Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society devoted to space travel </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At that time, the projects of artificial satellites had already been launched and it was clear that the area of space research in the future. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> At the beginning of the year 1956, society astronautics polish (PTA) déploya efforts to enter the international astronautics Federation (created in 1951) and in the autumn, the PTA in became a regular member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), became vice-president of the Federation of international travel. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> It conserva his office until his death in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> From 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the rocket Meteorological RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first polish rocket to carry out scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch occurred on 10 October 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> This rocket with a range of 1,800 metres had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> The result was built by an improved version, RM-1A and, during the summer of 1959, test flight of the rocket to two storeys RM-2 were launched in the desert of Bledov. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> This rocket had a length of 1.4 metre and probably weighed 11.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> The prototype that should have been capable of carrying out scientific work concrete-RM-34 missiles have a range of up to 14.5 km and serve to observe the wind in altitude. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> But in 1963, all the development work was halted. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> The rocket Meteor-1 developed during the 1962-1965, installed the first rocket-type RM. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> This rocket, designed with two tiers, had a total of 510 cm length and weight of original 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> Three models (called Meteor-1A, 1B-and-1C) were developed; they are distinguished by the dimensions of the space for the scientific tools. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> The rocket Meteor-1A had an area offering a volume of 0.4 per litre, while in Meteor-1b this volume was $0.34 per litre and Meteor-1C of 0.62 per litre. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The significance of all these types of gear was 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> In the period 1965-1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aeronautical institute, the first test flight began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> The rocket Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a burden worth 10 kg at an altitude of around 60 km. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Later versions were built the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> It has yet to mention the entry of Poland to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national committee COSPAR two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> Under the programme Interkosmos, Poland has also participated in space exploration on the soviet satellites artificial and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimir Remek, the second – non-soviet programme. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The repeal of the law on the work of public utility is not a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week, the Constitutional Court has repealed the law on the work of public utility. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> This decision has raised in the public a heated discussion. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> No doubt it is interesting to look at this issue from a broader view. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> The economic systems geared towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation are founded on the principle of more economic competition unregulated. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> In practical terms, this means that economic entities and national economic systems are constantly in conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> This is the principle of free trade and the free movement of capital (without limits) private ally unrestrained financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> The significant differences in the cost of labour (salaries) generate tension on prices. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> It is under this term meaning: a producer tries by the import of goods sold cheaply to resist economic competition in “making it more expensive,” the price of competitor, in order to take a greater share of the market and to increase its own profits. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> Large-scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: is shifting production abroad, either to buy cheap, either disappear. the result is high unemployment in the countries where prices are high compared to other economies. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Given that the private capital has no responsibility from a social point of view and thereby responsibility toward the unemployment it engenders, the social costs of the state increase necessarily. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> This whole situation intensifies the perfect unwillingness of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and to compensate for the social and economic damage caused to the whole of society in this race for profit. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> This situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide data concrete statistics. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> The unscrupulous practices of private capital in the various economies create a situation in which the governments of different countries are forced to engage in a mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own people in order to attract foreign capital. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words, governments are putting their own population at the mercy of private capital without taking account of social collapse. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This is evident mainly in the amendments to the laws in force. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The goal is to force economically on its own population to accept the dictates of the price of private capital, particularly in the area of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This happened first by a system of economic constraints in cases of long-term unemployment and secondly by restricting the rights of employees in the area of employment legislation. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> The result is a growing poverty and deepening differences between the rich and the poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> In Germany, there are points for years the public distribution of food for the poor who cannot meet their needs with their own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> There are already millions by the number of these people. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the german economy, it becomes quite aware that employees receive such salaries that the state is forced to pay extra to the bare minimum. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> Such a scandal, for example, has been updated in the case of employees working as carers in the federal Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The economy of almost all the southern countries of the EU generate, without doubt, a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of the society, people are forced to migrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or just stumble along with poverty wages, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day the private capital to invest in their countries. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> Now we have to ask the question: where will the capital? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will rise from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or even a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, a Égyptien or African will continue to work for a fraction of a salary. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This is also about Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> The liberal theory and the media claim to be tired, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that led economy led to an economic disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Private capital fiercely defends the idea that the state should not intervene in the economy by regulatory interventions. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Then we should ask themselves if private capital would not influence and, even, does not drive today, according to its own selfish interests, politics and the state as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The proof is that there is an almost all-powerful lobby and present in all states. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> This results in a desperate situation erupts in the area of corruption, by granting mutual benefits in the legislation, where everything is reprehensible, but not a criminal offence. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany, the situation is such that, due to the lack of financial resources, the national ministries delegate the draft laws to law firms, closely related to the industry. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> These bills are then adopted in the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> The entire power comes not from the people, as saying the constitutions of western type, but powerful financial groups serving their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> It is clear that democracies-oriented liberalism are now quickly face the situation described by Appianos in his book “the crisis of the Roman Empire at the time of Caesar and Pompée”: “the state was long in full decline and functions were attributed by violence. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> The blows of bribes, favors obtained illegally, and the stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> The bribes and corruption have proliferated without limits and people travelling to the elections with voices already sold” … “honest people does not seek to obtain functions, the result was once the state remained 8 months without consuls” … “we really began to say that the remedy to this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it should choose a man energetic” … it is true that Appianos Pompée had in mind, but it is Caesar who transformed irreversibly democracy in absolute rule. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> In conclusion, as in antiquity, the current society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard for the interests of society as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> In essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and to assert the interests of society as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> As a result, today as in the past, a decadence without prior elites, with no effort to carry out reforms. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> We therefore need to find the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the liberalisation unscrupulous economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> As things stand, we can see the disappearance of these systems to the benefit of liberal democracies as a kind of pause before a new stage. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> The fact that the elites current completely ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses in human lives, the humanitarian and social crises that we are witnessing today and crimes against humanity as we know from history and recent. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The repeal of the law on the work of public utility is not a solution, at least in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under the pressure of economic competition, both internationally and domestically, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> This trend is systemic. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The solution lies in reforms aimed at social, which will strengthen the capital investment of the state in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society to benefit the state. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: laboratory of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> “Nothing will come out of the violence never and never will,” says Sting in song entitled to fragile whose main refrain is “do not forget how much we are fragile.” </seg>
<seg id="1293"> “If my son does not want war, there would not have been any,” said Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his deathbed in 1849. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions are high. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Some are taking the side of Israel, asserting its right to self-defence and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, citing racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and Israel view as a terrorist state. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is a victim, in its recurring waves of killings; after all, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, are born in the present political situation and have not lived through the beginning of the violence. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> I would like to offer readers a view “located behind the curtain”, in which mainly benefits the tensions that persist for more than 95 years (from the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small country in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> Some of these thoughts are based on historical facts available to the study, others from my own understanding of, or more precisely the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of events in modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of mankind is primarily the story of a struggle for power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> Each time, we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> What is not so clear is whether these individualities acting independently or if they had their acts to the throne to someone who ran their acts according to previously defined objectives. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We must admit that we live in a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration causing some financial powers could not happen in the course of a single generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Among families with an astronomical wealth stands out particularly the Rothschild family, that could be seen as the head of the octopus (I know if these families still have a leader, but I do not exclude). </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Little is writing about them. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> Since the 1990s the 19th century, they have acquired the first press agency World (Reuters) in order to put an end to the establishment of ties between their name and serious criminal acts for which they were involved and who had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, increasing their wealth or both. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> They have major stakes in almost most central banks in the world and preparing or waging wars against countries in which they have not yet of such shares (before the invasion of Afghanistan, the number of these countries were 7, after the invasion of Iraq, 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only 4, meanwhile, Russia has placed the Russian Central Bank under the control of the russian government). </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Anyone who has tried to stand up against this family is dead. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Bank of America of Rothschild status of Central Bank and began to make during the civil war his own money (government, I hear) and was assassinated in a theatre in 1865. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> Jfk began to make clean money and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was assassinated in 1963, the MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 when he wanted to initiate proceedings against the EDF for having triggered the economic crisis of 1929. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Their thirst for power globally has led in the years 1859 in 1871 to formulate a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a the Freemasons initiated in the 33rd degree, the highest level. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The first war was designed to eliminate the large state monarchies of Europe, the second should remove colonialism, including british, and the third should reduce the global population between 0.5 and 1 billion people (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (the œcuménisme nothing other than the beginnings of such a solution) and, ultimately, gain an absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method used by the clan of families richer spearheaded the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos-the following order chaos). </seg>
<seg id="1314"> These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF intended to avoid repetition not crises as they began in 1907). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> Having managed to trigger the first world war by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-hungarian throne Habsburg, they destroyed Tsarist Russia in causing the Bolshevik revolution. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The first world war ended abruptly by a german capitulation without justification economic and military (the war was no longer necessary to the destruction of Czarist Russia) and it was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> Easier for an outbreak of the second world war, bankers have left politicians create a situation of latent conflict: they have one imposed on Germany to enormous war reparations and creates the conditions of a radicalization of the impoverished masses (it then put a sufficiently forceful leader, pointing the finger of blame, offering simple solutions) and, secondly, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong german minority who should play the role (she actually held) to fifth column to put the fire and start a war. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspira to the creation of a jewish state, preferably in the region of Judea historic with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The Balfour Declaration mentioned above laid the groundwork for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the initial friction with the local population Arab began. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> Terrorist acts were committed on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The second world war broke out; it is difficult to judge whether Hitler has broken the chains in which international bankers had taken initially; or if all he did was planned, the fact is, however, that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the foundations of the acceptance of a jewish state in the world community. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way that war reparations imposed on Germany were at the origin of the second world war, the founding of the State of Israel has lit a conflagration could cause a third world war. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If international bankers come to war, the jewish population is as it was during the second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as the population generally Arab or Muslim Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is like a giant laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but at international level (it enough to see how people are bitterly divided between supporters and defenders of Israel). </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-palestinian conflict, where a wrong creates another wrong according to a circle of violence and where you find the origin of all, the greed of some individuals and their desire to acquire the power on the world? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> It is the difference between ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because as home, international bankers do not propose to people in elections that their own candidate. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The present Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a politician fascist-type, loyal toward the international bankers, all in order to start a war with Iran, which could, because of the country&apos;s accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc …) expand to become a global conflict and, given that Iran control the Strait of Hormuz through which pass 20% of all the oil world (this corridor shipyard has a breadth of 2 miles) and create a destruction of the global economy. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> Under what light now appear the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: “the only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order.” </seg>
<seg id="1329"> In their view, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> A world in which every new born is located at birth a microchip make him be a totally controlled. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> “What they require all individuals, large and small, rich and poor, free and slave to bear on the hand or the front a red mark on the railways, so that it can buy or sell those who do not bear the name of this savage beast or the number of his name. </seg>

<seg id="1334"> This number naming rights and it is six hundred and sixty six.” </seg>
<seg id="1335"> The film Argo: when everything goes to the most evil, called Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> In November 1979, a crowd of demonstrators made up of Islamists took students stormed the US embassy in Tehran and retint 52 diplomats hostage. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> They should be released in exchange for the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which supported his regime for decades. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> The situation did not offer to the american administration positive outcome, it could not, in fact, abandon the Shah, because it would have severely shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, she was able to obtain the release of the hostages. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, blow compounded later by the fiasco of the attempt to free the hostages by force. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> The diplomats kidnapped were eventually released 444 days later, following the negotiations held by the algerian government. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> Their fate inspired the United States a wave of solidarity and an anti-iranian. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> The debacle iranian contributed greatly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter with Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections of 1980. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The film Argo, the actor and director Ben Affleck, described an episode of this story, which offered a small victory to America. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Just before she was occupied, six workers échappèrent embassy. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> After the turns complicated, they found themselves at the residence of the ambassador of Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> In collaboration with the canadian authorities, the CIA did succeed in getting them out of Iran through a bizarre coverage: they fled the country with canadian passports as members of a camera crew come make repérages for a film set in great spectacle of science fiction. </seg>

<seg id="1352"> The film Affleck is an unusual combination of various kinds. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> It is a part of a political thriller designed realistically but also a “caper movie,” the story of a successful coup, a stealth-like, for example, in the trilogy, Ocean&apos;s eleven, twelve and thirteen. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> The ambiances occur: sequences of Tehran-style documentary (in the sequences subtitled are presented the iconic photographs of the time of the events and how, thanks to these pictures, these same situations have been recorded in the film, there are no major differences), </seg>

<seg id="1360"> It is also the first film that Affleck is not taking place in his home city, Boston. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that put its first films above the standard Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> Affleck is also proof of this sense of the atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran “held” by Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes of the film takes place in the streets during the reconstruction of facts; the original sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which also suggests the confusion and the unpredictability that occur when suddenly, in a word, is writing a page of history. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect in the fictitious scenes (the wrong camera crew in the bazaar in Tehran). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too many actions in too many places </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director has had to settle for a subject offering few scenes in the film, thrilling sense of the term. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> It is performing well, sometimes it adds some elements to reality here, and the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at the airport in Tehran is ruled out by a telephone call in America and continuing on the runway are quite far-fetched.) </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The weakness of Argo lies in its character dissipated, due to the need to show too many things to too many different places. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role of cooperators Hollywood, their characters deserve a place more and are not far from the only ones in this case. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> The film Affleck lack a bit of dramatic tension, he leaves with a moderate interest, appreciating the achievement and the retro style of the 1970s. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> It leads to the viewer, but with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> As a reminder of a story, in a way, unfinished, and as an illustration the exaggerated the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscients, it does matter. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> The rules for inflating balloons, bananas and the circus </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The server www. bankovnipoplatky. com, which conducts every year a public inquiry on the bank charges the most absurd, has now decided to launch the contest in regulation or ideas from “the workshop” absurd. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> “The fact that the EU is planning, recently adopted a quota of 40 percent of women for the direction of large european companies has been at the root of our decision,” said to the newspaper Právo the organiser of this investigation, Patrik Nacher. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> Among the inconsistencies, it already is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify the insurance premiums for men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> Until now, however, women were an advantage for tariffs on life insurance because they represent, objectively, less risk for insurance companies. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> People can say until the end of the year another incredible idea of “the workshop of the EU”. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> “The vote will take place before the end of February 2013”, has informed Nacher. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> Among the controversial regulations of the EU, for example, the obligation to add components of bio-fuels, which have harmful consequences for the environment, or ban the use of reliable mercury thermometer, only because they contain a relatively low amount of a dangerous substance or the Directive on the size of cages for hens, which led to the increase in the price of eggs. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> There has also been criticism of the past against the ban on using the expression “butter chocolate spreads” or the withdrawal of the sale of traditional bulbs. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> The bananas must be a size 14 centimetres. </seg>
<seg id="1383"> The european administration reacts often under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually held in Brussels by a state or a group of states (and the Czech Republic currently imposes the requests of its banks by threatening to use its veto). </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, the origin of the fact that in the Union, bananas must not be a size below 14 cm or present a “abnormal curvature”. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> The European Commission is defended by arguing that it was merely harmonise national standards not homogenous which complicate the trade. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> The standards for fruit and vegetables were relaxed despite the opposition of some states, claiming that the existing directives involve a waste of food. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> The first prize will be awarded in this investigation to EU regulation last year that should be on balloons gonflables a warning that children under 8 years should not inflate without adult supervision. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The EU has made reference to a US inquiry that balloons are among the toys, the first cause of death of children by suffocation. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years for which is blowing trumpets in the zoo. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> Here too, there are suspicions. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> The rule on european officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece, anyone with an official function within the EU cannot use the name “Macedonia” and to talk instead about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). </seg>
<seg id="1392"> In collaboration with the association “allow turning” consisting of liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky. com has appointed in this investigation, in addition to some nonsense mentioned above, the EU regulation on the volume of reserves of food products on the territory of the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU has set the maximum amounts for the reserves of food products can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic the day of our membership of the EU. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The Czech Republic dépassa then, for instance, the volumes set for canned risqua, mushrooms and a heavy fine. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The organisers of this investigation found interesting idea of paying money to some countries because they have no access to the sea and the idea of giving a subsidy to ask the granting of subsidies. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> These ideas, however, are not from Brussels and Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> “Not having sea we handicaps. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> We are going to ask the European Union a reimbursement.” and expressed, in the autumn of 2004, the agriculture minister then Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD). </seg>
<seg id="1399"> It argues that, because of our wheat production, and following the purchases “interventionist”, the state was found with full of stocks that we had to then export. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> According to palas, the EU should have to pay millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from ports. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> Ultimately, the European Commission responded positively to the request and Czech held a tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> The subsidies to obtain subsidies have been proposed to the Commons by the Ministry of local development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), they should actually serve to write applications for grants by Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> The EU says: “the bizarre regulations are rare.” </seg>
<seg id="1404"> If the regulations are often criticised in the States, according to many experts, the efforts by EU regulatory and improving the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union and in the area of its development, rather than general deserve praise. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> More serious is, for example, according to the experts, the problem of the use of EU subsidies for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with the strengthening of european integration, but which have been imposed by the Member States during the budget negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The fact that the Czech Republic should, as other EU countries in Brussels, fighting for the right to use the specific names for these products traditional fight (which it does not always wins) raises strong emotions among the Czechs. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the czechs have successfully defended the title “Olomoucké tvarůžky”, in the name of “Tuzemský rum” which dates back home in the 19th century, our producers have had to replace it with the name “Tuzemák.” </seg>
<seg id="1408"> Only the products of alcohol of cane sugar, and not out of sugar beet, may carry the name of rum. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> In the official list of products made from the EU are today in the company of world-renowned as the Feta cheese or Gorgonzola, massepain of Lübeck or Parma ham and biscuits of Karlovy Vary (“Karlovarské suchary”) of carpes Pohořelice and Třeboň (“Pohořelický has Třeboňský kapr”) and hops of Žatec (“Žatecký chmel”). </seg>
<seg id="1410"> The bread of épice of Pardubice (“Pardubický perník”), and the cakes called “Cornets of Hořice” (“hořické trubičky”) can also be proud of their trademark. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> People want that I saved the republic, but I am only an amateur, says Senator Okamura </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Mr Senator, how is the idea to stand in presidential elections? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> This is not to be a senator or president who account for me. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If everything works without problems in our country, I would not be a candidate anywhere. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I do not support more see as the country is plundered for the last 20 years that the thieves are not in custody and the taxes and the retirement age increase. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> I had no ambition to become a politician. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> But when I see something that does not feel happy, then I try to offer a solution for that change. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And as I have over 40 years and that I am, independent of any party, I have no other solutions to influence the situation that present the presidential or Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> You entered the Senate but you have quickly set en route to the Castle (N. s. T.: chair). </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Is it that you do not turn back to the people who elected you? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I have always said that I am launching in the battle for the castle, according to the results of the senatorial elections </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Afterwards, I said that if I was elected senator, I come to the presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> My aim is not the function, it is merely an instrument allowing me to realize my vision. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> This is why I need to influence the largest and broadest. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The problem is not just that as a nation we râlons in the bar or in front of the television, but it is also that we are stalling all those who are trying to make the change. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> Added to that is the press that scrapping the reputation of people and confuses freedom of speech and freedom of lying. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> It has, for example, stated in my speech I soudoie journalists or that I was the adviser Jiří Paroubek. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> Turning to your visions. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> You began the fight for the castle with as warhorse of the subjects of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and tax declarations retroactive beyond 20 million [CZK]. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> You need to change the law. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> As President, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How do you solve this problem? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> When as a citizen, I have lobbied for the activities of tourist guides are a profession, I have succeeded. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem is the politicaillerie: when someone reaches of left or right with a good project, it is deliberately refused and it delays the citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As independent, a member of any party, I have many more opportunities to get the support of all parliamentary parties. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> I have the advantage of power without categorisation and dogma of every party supporters, take what is best for our country and implement it. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> You look rather like a man of left or right? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> A view of Czech, I have the impression that people would rather put in left. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me, that is a little to the left or right, this is not really important. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> For me, the important thing is that we go forward. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> What matters to me is not that people are left or right but to unite people. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> I always support any solution contributing to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS and I act equally impartially against bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> Is that how you enragez when someone tells you that you are a populist? </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But what you said the evidence does not? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> When you develop a business plan in a company, you have a certain optimal purpose and vision. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> You try to bring you in. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> Some may call it populism, but all the proposals that I have been applied by the world and recognized experts have spoken. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without the support of Parliament, you have that slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> You do survivrez not long in politics with this. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Do you think that if you are going to see people and their talk, you succeed, for example, to impose liability and criminal material? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no other option. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> I need to convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to rally them in my camp to impose. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> If I was elected president, it is not a problem to broadcast television my request to the chairmen of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> They should then possibly explain why they do not want. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> When there is a strong personality who identify abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Take, for example, the election of the president in direct elections, it has been achieved through public pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> I confess, bluntly, being an amateur, and not a genius or an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> I try to find allies for my views and my visions. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> I have to engage in politics and I am trying to get majority support for my programme. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> I try, alone, to make things, and if it does not work, I dwell in six years and I return to the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> It is a bit like Okamura should save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I am not a savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that one person can make a difference, which is why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to present themselves as the Senate elections. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the volume of work. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> I have at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová which revealed the fraud with oil. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> I presented myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty percent of people did not vote and what did have, for the most part, given their voice to a representative of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> In the Senate, there are only two independent. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> The people have elected a Senate that will be difficult to impose changes. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Despite everything, I will fight for my vision, for example the election to the direct election of mayors and prefects of regions. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Do you base your own party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> No, not yet, because I do not have the time to check if the past of each potential member is clean and then I do not have the financial means. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> I have no money for my presidential campaign, I have that twenty thousand on my account “transparent”. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> You have no money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> You talk about tax declarations, what is yours? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> I think about 60 million the value of my personal belongings. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> I was in Prague a ground 25 million, an apartment to a value of 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth around 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb worth $1 million and a few million in my account. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> Incidentally, I have an Aston Martin, because it was a dream boy: I have always liked James Bond, who was drunk in car, galant with women and fought against the evil and abuse. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> You drive in Aston Martin, you have a heritage worth 60 million and you have no money for your campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> You want to change the Republic but you do not want to invest your own money? </seg>
<seg id="1481"> This is not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I have not 15 million for this campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> I will have to borrow? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> I have already invested 2 and a half million in the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that I have no sponsor shows that my programme does not generate much interest. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> I do not have the obligation to pay this campaign in my pocket. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> My expenses are covered by the campaign overall remuneration that I receive as a senator. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But I could not live on, for example, pay school english my son which costs 30 thousand per month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If my only goal was to make money, I will not be a candidate for election. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> You will therefore continue your business activities to live? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Did you not stated that you put down your activities? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But this is not linked to the amount of remuneration. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As I promised, I partly reduced my activities. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, my deputy take spring the direction of travel agency. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> People would like I am a Samaritan who saves the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But although I live in something. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> What was your usual monthly salary when you were entrepreneur? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> I gagnais and I continue to earn between two hundred and four hundred thousand. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> If I were President, I would end my commercial activities. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> You will find this interview in the Saturday edition of the newspaper Práva. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> The architects of the cabinet MVRDV prove that the real adventures are not just a matter of imagination, if it is enough to contemplate Spijkenisse and the mountain of newly-built £2 pictures </seg>
<seg id="1502"> “I find that this building is marrant, it is very futuristic, finally something interesting to see,” said Lisette Verhaig, a broad low-on the side of the street. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> Stefan Spermon, a computer programmer in a large company nearby, we said: “yes, it is indeed well, this building.” </seg>
<seg id="1504"> But I wonder why we still need today for a library. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> Everyone has an iPad, Internet and e-books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> Now, nobody will voluntarily in one of these libraries elderly, no? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spijkenisse, a city-dormitory towns which is not attractive to the gates of Rotterdam, holds a record quite particular. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> The common 80,000 souls showing the rate of education, the weakest of the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> In order to restore some neurons in the brain, the city has decided that a few years ago, contributing to the general culture and replicate the seven bridges shadow on the euro notes in the form of cute miniature in small concrete painted. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of the offensive cultural remained restricted. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> This is how the authorities in the city have realised that there was only one way to take the lead on statistics: the construction of a library! </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Winy Maas, the office of architects of Rotterdam MVRDV, master of the charts in bold sticks and creator of buildings full of spirit and often cynical, accepted the project with his usual stiff upper lips and appeared in the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a sneer on his face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while the members of the jury is still watching, bewildered and shrugging the shoulders, Maas, the brazen, empila its books of choice in order of size into a pyramid, and ended his speech echoed arguments to activists by a common: “dear!” </seg>
<seg id="1514"> It is my proposal for the mountain of books from Spijkenisse, or as we say, the Boekenberg! </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, the mountain of EUR 30 million has gushed. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> The edifice is part of a revitalization project will also feature an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and houses mitoyennes for a total of 50 homes. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> In early November, the mountain of books has received the second price “Best Library of NL 2012 .” </seg>
<seg id="1518"> In addition, the project has been selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> That is how this small village, dull, which until now had nothing more to offer than a post-modern piétonne area and a mayor of a woe staggering, whose facades white to think they harbour a dairy, ascended to a contemporary architectural practice. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now has the first building public cultural history. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long road to reading </seg>
<seg id="1522"> First impression: El Dorado book under glass to cheese. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> Certainly, an elevator transports you to the heart of the massive, but the real joy of reading and architecture is open to you when you foulez soil of the building to the discovery of its topography. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> The internal entirely made of glass is bright and clear, the soil in dutch bricks and lampposts elegant unequivocally speak the language of municipal public squares. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban atmosphere is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> We are already looking at the public benches, dogs and boys and girls who play the ball. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> Everywhere, and books, books and more books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> “Normally, the library shelves are along the coast and in the middle is a room large and dark, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal,” explains Willy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We have completely changed the configuration classic space and open spaces of reading from the inside to the outside. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The interior of the mountain of books has been skilfully constructed: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the club of failures, the Centre for Environment and the technique of building. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> A special beauty lies in the black shelves of the library, which are sometimes of lambris, sometimes of balustrades, sometimes the ramps staircase. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> A new experience for sight, touch and odorat. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even the architects and engineers building hardened do not want materials unknown. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> “We wanted to work with recycled materials,” explains Joop Trouborst, head of the common Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> This is a day we found in a farm Friesian waste ad hoc from agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> In the Netherlands, used for years to the synthetic membrane of a millimetre thick as substrate in greenhouses and fields. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> It is cheap and we win over time. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, then you can throw it. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> For the library, the membrane was steamrollered, for the first time in such quantities, sclerosis thick four centimetres. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Because of the heat and pressure, the “Landbouwplastic” (KPL) exchange of colour and turns into a dark material, consistent and resilient, whose smell evokes both a new car and trainers. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> At the top of the 105 marches is the summit of the mountain. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> After almost 500 metres, coffee literary offers us an impregnable on the city, but also the croquettes Dutch and ficus in pots. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> They create an atmosphere, but they all contribute to maintaining the ideal level of moisture in the air of the mountain of literature. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Donations for the new soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> “It is incredible, but despite all the areas of glass, this building is a model in terms of ecology,” assigns Trouborst. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> The temperature of the edifice is regulated by geothermal power. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Although the mountain of books is below a line of glass, the sun illuminates that little time inside, even the days of good weather. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> The thick wooden beams from across the facade of glass are bull-sun listening, a large part of the shelves. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> The mood is very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The fully automated blinds can do the rest. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned septique computer programmer, is already risky to enter the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Lisette Verhaig also was already there. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> Cynthia Bogarde, traditional chinese medicine, even the Boekenberg describes as the “soul” of Spijkenisse finally restored. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, every citizen has been invited to donate a book from his personal library. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> This allowed to fill the gaps in the library, which was still not completely garnie (today, with 70,000 pounds). </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The concept is a success. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The shelves are full of all sides. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> For the architect Winy Maas, “there is nothing worse than a half-empty library.” </seg>
<seg id="1559"> “I believe that our invitation has created some relationship between the individual citizen and this new building. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Everyone knows that his book is part of this building. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Even if this is only for the decoration.” </seg>
<seg id="1562"> This is as MVRDV has reached the discipline mistress called, in the professional jargon, “the creation of an identity.” </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Spijkenisse has written a new page of literary history. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> Although it may seem young and poorly educated. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Finally, it is a new starting point for the birth of an identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Szabo: “the Germans must play a larger role.” </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of the palestinian state. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, expert on relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week, Germany had announced his intention to vote against the Palestinians asked to obtain the status of observer state at the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But she then chose abstention. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany does not agree with what the Israelis did in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> However, Berlin should be cautious, because it maintains special relations with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But I also think that it does not support the US position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to assert its independence, but without being too critical of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained in the vote on the implementation of a no-fly zone. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> Finally, NATO implied this measure. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Germany finds it difficult to take a clear position on major international issues? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> The answer is yes. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> The reason is that Berlin is currently revising its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy as defined by the Americans and establish a german foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> Moreover, the lack of coherent policy and common within the Union complicates the situation. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> The Germans have therefore on several fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> We expect them to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I think they still find tâtonnent for this role, but are on the path to a foreign policy more “normal”. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> A foreign policy, as in France or Britain </seg>
<seg id="1586"> That means in practice then the term “normal” foreign policy to the Germans? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It shows the willingness to adopt positions independent from those of the United States and the european partners, including the national issues. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that german foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, so by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> The german economic interests are, to some extent, are different from those of the other great powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> These economic interests have influenced the position of Germany towards the Middle East conflict and abstained from the UN vote? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> Germany has first to important markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> That is why Berlin must take care not to offend the public, but also the elites of the arab countries. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> It is undoubtedly a crucial element. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> However, I did not rate too much importance, because it is not exclusively unilateral relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But that is in any case a determining factor in the german strategic considerations. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Germany night to its relations with the United States in choosing the abstention of important votes, as in the case of Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I believe that the Europeans and Americans understand perfectly the german position. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> That is why I think the divide is not as serious as it was in the case of Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps that Germany will be more respected. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> Indeed, Germany has demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests have to be taken into account. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe, the opinions on the palestinian initiative are diverse. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> By contrast, the United States announced their veto of a clear voice. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> Opinions differ between the United States and the majority of european countries? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> There have always been differences because of the domestic political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the Obama administration secretly greater understanding towards the european position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But given the political configuration of the country, the government of course cannot defend his position publicly. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so large that they always seem. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, you notice that Obama is not too keen on the policy of Netanyahu. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Germany finds it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, with the position of the large european partners? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I think that it will not make things any easier for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans, if there was a coherent european policy and uniform, but today, this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> So they cannot take place within a broader policy line and must affirm their peculiar position. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> That is what they are doing in the current issue of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> In my opinion, Germany to assume a future role of locomotive and push Europe to adopt a european position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> This is not easy for Germany, partly because of relations with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This question has always been tricky. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But to me, the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a role which marks more independence. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Germany is playing a role of weight on the international stage, Germany wants it just assume a key role? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Or was it always difficulties to take leading roles on? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany is still not used, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still struggling to play a more important role. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> If you look at, for example, the euro crisis, we notice that whenever Germany decides to weigh more, many feelings antiallemands is heard. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> It does not make things any easier for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> In fact, it is always the same problem: they do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> This point of view, Germany is in a far worse position than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It must deal with neighbours and opinions very varied, and this is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Today, the United States&apos; influence on european policy is decreasing, but at the moment, the EU does not fill that vacuum, then who is? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans simply play a more important role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> And even if it does not like, even if it is unpleasant and if they are less popular, this is the life! </seg>
<seg id="1629"> Stephen Szabo is the deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy of Washington, an institute in which academics and policy experts from Europe and North America are analysing all the challenges of the transatlantic community. </seg>
<seg id="1630"> Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he specialised in german politics, in american foreign policy and transatlantic relations. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> “Protection of trademarks in China”: when Puma and Armani become suddenly chinese </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Armani and Ralph Lauren Polo trademarks are known throughout the world. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Armani Polo … what is it really? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> Behind this lies a trademark officially in China, but that has nothing to do with the original company. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> The brand has a protection as the company that bears the name cannot complain. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> And even if it could, it is not certain that it would gain. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> “It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,” explains Thomas Pattloch, lawyer cabinet Taylor Wessing specialises in violation of property rights in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Each week, a new dossier arrives on my desk. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> The copycats require only a few extra letters to register their brands. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> Thus, instead of Gucci, recorded Lu-Gucci, Prada, and instead of being recorded Prada-Kny. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> German companies are also copy legally, as Puma, the sportswear manufacturer. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> Pattloch opens a good filing in which the registrations to brands of Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> On September 14, 2010, a chinese company has tabled the brand Zegna DF Puma, a designation that the firm has artificially created by removing part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the home of fashion. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> It is a known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of copying and violation of intellectual property. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In the big cities, you find business centres on several floors that sell almost as counterfeits. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> The case of Pattloch, however, are different: its clients the task of addressing the fact that the chinese trademark office confers officially to chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> The Chinese speak of “Bang Mingpai” brand relative. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The term is derived from “Bang Dakuan.” </seg>
<seg id="1649"> It is with this term that are designated for women who are married to men rich. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> The chinese authorities say have nothing to blame. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> “This is bad for business, we must fight against this trend,” requires Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> “The brand is diluted, the outlier disappears, the damage to reputation are enormous.” </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The financial losses and legal costs running into millions for the sectors concerned, especially regarding the flagship products are expensive. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the society of analysis of the market, CLSA China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the third world market for luxury goods and the fastest growing. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> However, it is not easy to delete recordings dubious register trademarks and these procedures are expensive. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> These can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Pattloch mentions the trial in which the court has rejected the complaint, because after a long period, criticised the name had become a “market reality.” </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Pattloch explains that if the complainant has no chance, it may even be forced to pay money to plagiaire, because it would have damaged its brand in China. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle prevails. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Famous cases include elements of graphics. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the manufacturer of machine site Sany, the same company which had to buy the manufacturer Putzmeister concrete pumps. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> That is why the Chinese can use a symbol that resembles the star Mercedes. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> Geely, Volvo, acquisiteur used before a blue and white logo which reminded BMW. the conflict was settled and Geely had to amend. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The fashion house Lacoste had lost against plagiaires of Hong Kong and Singapore who had shifted from the famous crocodile in the opposite direction. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> According to the chinese authorities, they are guilty of anything. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The office of brands CTMO Beijing admits, however, have experienced some difficulties in 2010 because of a lack of staff and space. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> However, the office would be spent last year of an “emergency situation in the course of the work to a normality restored.” </seg>
<seg id="1668"> Thus, the number of procedures opposition untreated have fallen by 22%. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Nearly 57,000 cases of this type have been closed, which represents an increase of 75% compared to the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> Nevertheless, 81,500 procedures remain outstanding in the Office. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> Act is expensive </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As so often in China, the figures are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Last year, the CTMO has received more than 1.4 million applications received marks, almost a third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> According to the agency, it is a record and this means that China is for the tenth consecutive top of the league for the number of new deposits in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> It would also for the total number of legal brands of 5.5 million. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> In 2011, the office have counted 1.8 billion yuan of law. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> In other words, each registration has reported average 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> A legal battle is costing much more, as illustrated by the case of the family enterprise German Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years, the company is fighting against a chinese plagiaire. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> Admittedly, the Germans could get the illegal manufacture of components of vehicle is suspended. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> However, the imitateur could maintain its rights on the chinese brand Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> “This is our fault, because the names of families cannot be protected in Germany,” explains Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the direction of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> The office of brands had therefore rejected the objection of Munichites. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> Freudenberg has certainly succeeded in following two bodies, but the other side continues to fight until today. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> The vigilance is required </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and praises the professionalism of the judges. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> However, he adds: “the process is long, bruising and costs us a lot of time and money.” </seg>
<seg id="1689"> It is also difficult to assess the internal costs. service archives has even had to review the acts of the last hundred years to give evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed in vain to the other side a “large sum in euros to six figures” to resolve the dispute. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> “This is what you see what this means for us,” assigns Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> The dangers of the Far East even threaten to spill over into Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> That would be the case if copycats of this region is assured the exploitation of brands are not protected. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> For example, a chinese producer wants to table in Germany on behalf of Freudenberg for a production company of footwear and leather. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> The company had long since abandoned this sector, but it could even prevent the submission. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> Wentzler adds: “the vigilance is required.” </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Pattloch and advising him to german companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough, they say, to rely on international law, trademarks, foreigners should instead “register in China is likely to be protected,” said Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise, the costs can be much more important than those of registration. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of his legal drama, the company should pay licence fees to the other side to use his own name, as Wentzler explains. </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Or, we lose our place on the segment of the market in question. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> World Day against AIDS: the rap, sing, help </seg>
<seg id="1703"> The choir Imbongi repeat in Heidelberg, and AIDS orphans in Swaziland welcome their arrival. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> This is the story of a link that takes more than a distance of 8,733 kilometres. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> First, we had the place: the cowboy boots, the trainers, the escarpins for the ladies and mocassins for men seeking the pace in striking the ground foot. very quickly, they find it. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> One, two, three, four. </seg>
<seg id="1707"> Then, the voices of singers is growing slowly-low, alto, tenor and soprano, they win, envoûtent and will follow. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> Fiete Hopf, the conductor 29 years almost loses his shoes backdrop when he leads the orchestra with gestures of a savage flexibility. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> We are on Monday evening, the choir Imbongi repeat a new song in the chamber music of the Institute of medical psychology Heidelberg. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> Fifty chanteuses and singers from 23 to 69 years came, the geneticist in medicine to human rights at home. </seg>
<seg id="1711"> “Om&apos;Obani” is not an easy piece, every choriste has different words in a language very exotic: zoulou, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in some regions of Swaziland. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> Be helped to help </seg>
<seg id="1713"> The UNAIDS, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS, estimates that 34 million people around the world are suffering from the disease. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> 23.5 million of them live in South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Swaziland account 245,000 people infected. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV positive. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni have found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association “Voices for Africa”. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> 70 of them attend an establishment of secondary education. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> For 15 or 20 euros for less, you can become godfather. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> This guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a hot meals daily centre gogo. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> Imbongi means “zoulou conteur stories” or even “singer praises.” </seg>
<seg id="1722"> No one can speak the language fluently Bantu in this region, but all can sing. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> For nearly 10 years, the choir repeat songs in this foreign language she has led Germany to now go to his home region: the South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> Because to 8,733 miles as the crow flies Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni village, which depends on the strength of the german voice choir. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> 40% of sufferers </seg>
<seg id="1726"> The village has about 2,000 residents, some live in small huts of straw or land, and the majority of them are children. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> More than 300 of them are orphans, because HIV has won their parents. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> To Esitjeni, can be seen on a smaller scale what ails Swaziland: the rate of HIV infection in the highest and life expectancy is the lowest in the world, according to UNICEF. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> The population accept virtually never male circumcision, a measure which ensures a proven reduction of the risk of infection by half. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> More than 40% of the population of Swaziland holds the immunodeficiency virus and it is not unusual to die in the middle of the 30. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> During a trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir had discovered the village. the Imbongis above all have seen many children in the street on which it lacked not only parental care, but also quite simply everything: food, clothing, education. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> In a poor country, school without qualifications, there is simply no prospect. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> At the beginning, it was just some people who are committed to personally pay a few euros each year in order to send a child to school and offer him a hot meals per day. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> But barely a year later, the choir based “Voices for Africa”, an association which deals since almost professional of AIDS orphans of Esitjeni. </seg>
<seg id="1735"> Facts about sexually transmitted infections </seg>
<seg id="1736"> What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases? </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Among the IST bacterial, with syphilis, chlamydiées and blennorragie (or gonorrhée). </seg>
<seg id="1738"> The current IST are HIV, Human Papilloma Virus, herpès génital or hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="1739"> The nits the pubis and remained belong to the IST parasitic. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> What are the groups mainly concerned? </seg>
<seg id="1741"> The syphilis and blennorragie appear often among men who have sex with other men. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The Robert Koch Institute, believes that sexual contact between men are at the origin of at least four cases of syphilis in five declared in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> Adult heterosexual infections linked to chlamydiées, trichomonase, candidose (fungal), the blennorragie and Human Papilloma Virus of sexually transmitted diseases are commonplace. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The rate of spread of HIV between heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany; however, some 20% of new HIV infections occur within this group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Among young people, there is a rate of infections linked to chlamydiées significantly higher than among other population groups. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> According to the records, three quarters of all infections involve young people aged 15 to 25 years. </seg>
<seg id="1747"> Moreover, in Germany, Human Papilloma Virus is common among young people. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> What is the change in the number of infections? </seg>
<seg id="1749"> It is not compulsory to declare all sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> According to the Robert Koch-Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: the figure is past 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections is decreasing. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases. </seg>
<seg id="1753"> This represents a decrease of 10% compared to the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> What are the symptoms of a disease sexual? </seg>
<seg id="1755"> Infectious diseases can cause boil at the level of genital pain, urinary, losses of white, low-belly pain as well as the appearance of buttons and verrues. </seg>
<seg id="1756"> However, they do regularly no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> How to protect themselves? </seg>
<seg id="1758"> Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> The reason is that the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by infected lubrifiante or close physical contact. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> Experts recommend to any person often changing of sexual partners to spend regular examinations. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> Most of the IST quickly HIV can be cured and aftermath late can be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> Through sponsorships, donations, but above all the funds that reaped the choristes thanks to their voice through Germany, the means are mounting. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> “In all, we have already sent approximately 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,” says Annette Lennartz, President of the Association. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> The village, Zodwa Dlamini, a woman sure of itself and which always gets what it wants, manages the money from Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> It also ensures that the orphans are well housed, in one of their grandmothers, for example. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> The gogos, and called the old women in zoulou, are the pillars of the village. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Some of them receive up to 14 orphans, they offer them a roof and ensure that they go every day to school in their uniforms. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> The orphan who has more person is welcomed in a safe place, among Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, like the two cooks prepare meals every day for more than 200 starving children. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> In addition, “Voices for Africa” has created a school of styling and allowed the construction of two barns. with the help of the american health PSI, the Association has organized a screening test HIV for many people. </seg>
<seg id="1770"> This is not, of course, because even if the disease is visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject. </seg>
<seg id="1771"> A king and his 14 wives </seg>
<seg id="1772"> “AIDS is a real taboo,” Annette Lennartz explains, “because it is a subject that affects sexuality.” </seg>
<seg id="1773"> It is quite strange, coming from a country where the king has 14 wives official. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> The last absolute monarch in black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Polygamy in place of democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> These mores sanctioned by the State, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> Yet we find condoms on every street corner, Annette Lennartz adds, “but almost nobody uses them. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> The culture is different, flesh against flesh.” </seg>
<seg id="1780"> In order to encourage a little cultural exchange, choristes of Imbongi go together in trip every two or three years in South Africa and telling songs full of nostalgia, courage, confidence and identity that black number of inhabitants of the dark continent still know the time of apartheid. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> The bus full of white singing in african language is a sign of recognition as it brings not only good humour and delight, but sometimes too hard a tear to a formidable border guards. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> The bus takes the always Esitjeni, where choristes visit their godchildren. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> Although it is difficult to find the small village on the map, Esitjeni is well known in the Valley Ezulweni. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> “Come on to Esitjeni, you find the light,” say the people there. </seg>
<seg id="1785"> And after a trip to 8,733 miles as the crow flies, return to Heidelberg, before these choristes who gets the foot in the room of repeated Bergheimer Straße, we also find the light. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> Messenger: NASA discovered the presence of ice on Mercure </seg>
<seg id="1787"> The probe Messenger reported evidence of ice on the planet Mercure. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> The ice could reach 20 metres thick. </seg>
<seg id="1789"> The US space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercure. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> Although this planet is closest to the Sun, it contains water frozen, as explained three studies published Thursday in the journal “Science specialist.” </seg>
<seg id="1791"> The probe Messenger reported evidence of the existence of a cover of ice in the region of the world permanently immersed in the shadows. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> This coverage have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters of up to 20 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> The water is probably comets or asteroids may have stung Mercure. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> However, nobody made a link between the discovery of water and the assumption of a presence of life on the planet, explains the chief scientist in the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> The temperature on Mercure can achieve 426 degrees Celsius. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> The discovery could help explain how the water and other essential elements to life arrived in other parts of the solar system. </seg>

<seg id="1811"> It is about 700 light-years away in the constellation of Verseau. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> Its similarities with a continent land have earned him the title of North America. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> The combination of the photo and normal photo of the infrared allows us to observe a bland spectacular. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope could capture an image of the new star in all its beauty. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> One of the great riddles of astronomy is the creation of the rings of Saturn. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> One theory is that the rings were the remains of a moon of Saturn who disappeared 4.5 billion years without trace. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> A photograph of the largest and most net that has taken the Hubble telescope is the galaxy of Tourbillon. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> According to the bland, photographs of galaxies maelstroms can become real works of art. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> A photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the amorphous of Trifide in the constellation of Sagittaire, several thousands of light-years away. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> The name comes from the Latin word “Trifide trifidus” (shared), divided into three, because three dragged dust luisant divide the heart of the place of birth of stars. </seg>
<seg id="1821"> The astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a carambolage cosmic in the constellation of Serpentaire: 400 million light years from Earth, the nuclei of two galaxies in merger rush one to the other, the collision is inevitable. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> The Hubble telescope has seen the birth of stars in the galaxy spiral M83. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> If you do not like the abbreviations technical, you can use his nickname of “wheel of fire Southern.” </seg>
<seg id="1824"> The photo of the Hubble space telescope, shows a detail of the cloud of the Iris, in the constellation of Céphée. </seg>
<seg id="1825"> The amorphous lies 1,400 light-years away and is composed of grains of dust which are ten to a hundred times smaller than the dust domestic routine. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> This picture was created from photographs taken by various optical and X-ray telescopes. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> You can see the circle composed of black holes, which is about 430 million light years from Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> Scientists have named the greatest spiral galaxy “GC 1810 .” </seg>
<seg id="1830"> In this cloud is the group of young stars the brighter of our Milky Way. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> The cradle Heavenly always gives rise to new stars. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> These clouds of stars, which are connected by the cloud of the rosette, also create permanently young stars to 5 000 light years from Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> In this galaxy the rays of light and breakthrough of a small black hole, there is still no dust, and gas. </seg>
<seg id="1834"> Scientists believe that he was born shortly after no Big Bang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> Our eyes on the universe: the main telescope </seg>
<seg id="1836"> The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo will use a year later to observe the stars. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Since then, the mirrors optical telescopes have continued to swell and thanks to them, it was possible to see still further in the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope at Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> The mirror image on this had a diameter of five metres. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> In Arizona, the United States is the Large Binocular Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> It allows us to observe the universe through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on La Palma in the Canary Islands, is immense. the mirror alone reached a diameter of 10.4 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been broken up in order to make savings. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> The diameter reached all eleven metres. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> The downside of the method of construction is that the telescope is set at the level of the vertical angle, which limit the mobility. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> The Hobby-Eberly Telescope would Texas is also set in the vertical angle. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> Its uniqueness lies in its capacity to collection of light. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> Despite a relatively small diameter of mirror, this ability to be closer to those of the largest telescope mirrors in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> Scientists listening to the universe in search of extra-terrestrial signals to the aid of radiotélescope of Arecibo (Puerto Rico). </seg>
<seg id="1850"> This radiotélescope has a diameter of 305 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1851"> Anyone who owns a computer can help to “the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI,” or “search for extra-terrestrial intelligence”) to leverage the power of calculating his machine. </seg>
<seg id="1852"> On the European Southern Observatory (ESO), in the Andes in Chile. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> Here lies the Very Large Telescope (“very large telescope”), a facility worthy of its name. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can enlighten the spectrum infrared mode. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> The construction of a huge telescope European (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the site of the ESO in Chile. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> Its main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 metres. it will be composed of nearly 1,000 elements of mirrors. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> However, the telescope will take photographs before 2018 at the earliest. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> Until 2007, two of the Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea volcano hawaïen of were considered the largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> They waved two mirrors with a diameter of 10 metres each. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> The Keck telescopes to form part of the observatory&apos;s Mauna Kea who observed the sky with the Subaru telescope and IRTF. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> A new giant telescope should also be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror reach 30 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> This illustration of the admiring. </seg>
<seg id="1863"> However, the images of the area the most important we come from the Hubble space telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> Since 24 April 1990, we book images of distant worlds. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler seeks exoplanètes, mainly those that are habitable. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> NASA announced on 2 February 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> This photo shows the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> The space telescope-James Webb&apos;s journey (JWST) will be sent into space early 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket. </seg>
<seg id="1869"> The first mirror the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> The telescope will be especially for mission to find the light cast by the first stars and galaxies after no Big Bang. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> Scientists believe that the south pole of Mercure is home also to the ice. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> However, any reliable data on this theory is because Messenger orbit much closer to the North Pole to Mercure. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> The data for decades radar indicated the presence of ice on Mercure. </seg>
<seg id="1874"> Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbiter around Mercure, scientists now have the certainty. </seg>

<seg id="1876"> In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible. </seg>
<seg id="1877"> There is even a museum of longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1878"> An investigation into a country, which is still relatively young to 97 years. </seg>
<seg id="1879"> In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible. </seg>
<seg id="1880"> There is even a museum of longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> An investigation into a country, which is still relatively young to 97 years. </seg>
<seg id="1882"> The trip in the Talysh Mountains is a romantic échevelé. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> In the course of many turning points on the road, the small bus cahote along wooded hills, rivers and modest torrentiels firm. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> Everything is green and fertile, you could almost imagine – in the Black Forest. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few miles away. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> It is here that the caucasian ethnic group in the name of Talysh, about which we know little, if they speak perfectly persian and Azeri and that they have a very great longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> Terminus: Lerik. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> The small town plastronne with its architecture is too aggressive in the soviet era, which is not in keeping with the landscape of picturesque mountain. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too painful. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> It takes eight hours to travel the 323 miles, because the road is only one way. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> The province has still not taken advantage of the legendary wealth that the country needs for its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist spot. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> “Baku became famous in May with the help of Eurovision, and next year there will be here the festival of older people in the world,” explains Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> She is director of the museum in longevity, the only museum in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> You can discover life of about eight dozen Talysh region which have over 100 years. Fatulayeva shows us a photo in black and white. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> My grandfather, he reached the age of 120 years. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> Having even one child to 136 years </seg>
<seg id="1898"> But the star of the controversial museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who had 168 years. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> There is, however, no birth certificates. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> And when you consider that the oldest person had documented 122 years, the age of Müslümov seems more questionable. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> “He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973,” says Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The man will be married three times and there have been 23 children at the age of 136 years, he even designed a girl. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> Şirali Müslümov would he misled few decades in calculating his age? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> Rembrandt Scholz, gérontologue at the Max-Planck Institute of Rostock has also heard of the great age of Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> “Surprisingly older people also live in some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” explains Scholz, “in Sardinia, too, there are men who live incredibly old.” </seg>
<seg id="1906"> However, it is impossible to establish a scientific proof of the existence of the documents, and that there was no registry of marital status. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> Every day, a glass of butter, melted </seg>
<seg id="1908"> It is, however, that the people of the region of Lerik often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> Currently, 20 people have more than 100 years. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> So what is the reason for the longevity in the south of the country? </seg>
<seg id="1911"> Farid Mugimzadeh tourist guides, the Azeri, explains that the Talysh have special genes. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> By contrast, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, believe that it is a question of food. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the rich meals calories of Talysh, who love meat, bread and milk products and how much daily drink a glass of melted butter, are good for the health. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or is this the lifestyle of simple preserves the young people to Cengemiran?, a tiny village near the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> With its 97 years, it is still relatively young for the region. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest home of wood, as it is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> It is sitting on the ground beside a baratte, it beats the content tirelessly. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> Eight people live here under one roof, including a son of Mirzayeva and a daughter, who has long since been adults. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> Two small children where also in the house. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> In the kitchen, preparing tea for the guests served in glasses armadus in typical form of belly. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> The teeth of white Mirzayeva are perfectly aligned, and under his scarf hiding long tresses of a blond ploughs his son reveals with pride. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> I have always washed my hair with milk, and so it is that I have never lost, and they have retained their color. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> “I have never used shampoo,” adds Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> The monthly pension is enough to live </seg>
<seg id="1925"> She always ate what comes from its own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> All my life, I have never bought any food in a supermarket. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Then, she speaks of her husband, who was in the army. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> The worst moments were after the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> But everything has improved when the “beloved father” Heydar Aliyev took the lead. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> The language of the propaganda surprises in the mouth of an old lady. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> However, the cult of the father of the nation, a man who has led his country as a dictator, is almost no limits in Azerbaijan </seg>
<seg id="1932"> He has been in power until 2003, his son Ilham installed him afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> Nevertheless, the elderly of Azerbaijan does not know the distress. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> Mirzayeva receives each month 230 manats (about the same amount in euros) for his retirement, a sum which guarantees a good pace of life in the region. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> And perhaps the son long greying of Mirzayeva is right: “the elders enjoy great respect in our culture.” </seg>
<seg id="1936"> They are the centre of the great family, they are loved, cared for and happy. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> That is a good reason to live as long as possible. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> The “human rights” omitted in the constitution </seg>
<seg id="1939"> The revolution has surfaced in Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> Rival protests reveal the deep divide in the country. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> The draft constitution based on Sharia law is hotly debated. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> The egyptian president is not sparing words more emotions. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> We need to manage the transition. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> “And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God,” he said on state television. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> His speech was designed for the entire nation, but especially to Coptic Christians, liberals, Christians and secular Muslims enlightened. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> Because all members of the opposition have fractured desperately confused and afraid. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> Mohamed Morsi said, almost in apologizing, having temporarily restricted the powers of the constitutional court and broadened its “to save the revolution.” </seg>
<seg id="1949"> However, the Egyptians and the world did not really know what to save the engineer of 61 years, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> The judiciary will it be overturned? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> The 234 articles written in haste by the Constituent Assembly majority islamic 100 people in a tour de force of night fifteen hours are worrying in a way. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> As in previous constitutions, the plan provides that the law is based on “the principles of islamic law”. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> But that really means the word “principles”? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists would use the vague wording and the leeway related legal to enforce a stricter interpretation of Sharia. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> In any case, it is that suggests a newly introduced stating that, regarding all matters relating to Sharia law, al-Azhar University must be consulted and establishing the islamic institution is the country&apos;s largest and its dazzling appearance on the whole islamic world Sunni. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> This, however, does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative machinery, which would lead to the de facto tutelage of judicial power. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> Many points in the draft constitution are subject to interpretation </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Another problematic aspect is the likely continuation of military jurisdiction. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> During the reign of Mubarak, these courts are employèrent to repress opposition. </seg>
<seg id="1960"> After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> The state must also, can be read in the draft, protect “the true nature of the egyptian family” and “promote its morals and values.” </seg>
<seg id="1962"> From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that the institutions of the state could control the content of the art cinema and literature. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Clearly, it would be simply to censure. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Moreover, no article explicitly guarantees equality between men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> Instead, another article prohibits offend or denigrating the Prophet Mohammed or his envoys. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> By contrast, the article does not define what is offensive or how it should be punished. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Also questionable is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to “offend people.” </seg>
<seg id="1968"> Is it enough to paint a caricature of President or tell a joke at the expense of a man of law? </seg>
<seg id="1969"> Many items are subject to interpretation in the project that Morsi submits to the vote and who, in his own words, “very soon” will be the subject of a referendum among Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> “The revolution renait” </seg>
<seg id="1971"> The opposition is mobilising for weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> On Friday evening, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in an unusual harmony on Tahrir Square in Cairo, vowing to unseat the Sharia before it enters into force. </seg>
<seg id="1973"> “The revolution is resurgent and we will win,” launches Hamdin (came third in the presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1974"> The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei said that the draft constitution is “to throw in the dustbin of history”. </seg>
<seg id="1975"> On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused the supporters of Morsi to foment a “coup against democracy.” </seg>
<seg id="1976"> “If he says the referendum, we will go to his palace and the reverse,” Jasser exclame Said, an opponent. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> “We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet expié”, said that the media Egyptians Khaled Ali, a politician and member of the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="1978"> In addition, several judges have announced will not want to monitor the referendum, which would lead to its revocation. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> “The Koran is our constitution” </seg>
<seg id="1980"> For its part, the Muslim Brotherhood, well organised, called for a counter-demonstration not on Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a large prayer was organised before the University of Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1981"> Headscarved women and the supporters of the Salafis, who participated in large numbers, chanted: “the people demand the application of the law of God.” </seg>
<seg id="1982"> “Clean our country!”, calling on Morsi, saying that “the Koran [was] their constitution.” </seg>
<seg id="1983"> A fight for sovereignty on the symbolic Tharir Square, where it all began, have quickly created a situation similar to that of a civil war. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> Obviously, this is what the supporters of Morsi wanted to avoid. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> The Muslim Brotherhood said that opponents of the draft Constitution, as his supporters have spoken loud and clear. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> According to them, it is now time to let the people decide at the ballot box in the direction for the country. </seg>
<seg id="1987"> The project of Islamists win certainly the majority. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> “Human rights are not mentioned only once” </seg>
<seg id="1989"> Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this constitutional process imposed which was due to run until February and include all the social forces. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> This human-rights lawyer for 48 years and chairman of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in the courts under Mubarak. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> He did not because he shares their view of the world, but because for him, human rights are indivisible. </seg>
<seg id="1992"> This is why it has been beaten up, convicted and imprisoned. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> “And now, the end is not even mentioned once in the new constitution,” regret it during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag. </seg>
<seg id="1994"> The extension of the powers of the three powers Morsi has discouraged the lawyer. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> These measures are blatant violations of the rules of democracy and they will create a new dictatorship in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> “Instead of strengthening civil society, the president would de facto loses all its powers,” laments Saeda. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> However, no democracy can function without civil society organisations. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between the different political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness. </seg>
<seg id="1999"> It could afford. </seg>
<seg id="2000"> A demonstrator on Tharir warns: “you accouchez a monster that it will not be possible to control.” </seg>
<seg id="2001"> The rakfisk Norway: is it the fish most odorant world? </seg>
<seg id="2002"> The five million people in Norway enjoy some of the highest levels of life, not only in Europe, but also in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> The secret of the success of the country could be linked to the appetite of the premises for a fish extremely odorant? </seg>
<seg id="2004"> Take cheese. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> Put them in the middle of a pile of clothes soccer wet and dirty. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> Wait a week. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> And you get the smell of disturbing rakfisk, one of the most popular dishes of Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> I am in the small town of Fagernes, approximately 3 hours of Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> Snow, the landscape is spectacular – and this smell, ubiquitous, permeates the air. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> The rakfisk consists of trout spread too thinly and salt fermented in the water for a period-according to the smell that you want it exhale – which can be up to a year. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> When darkness settles and it is cold, the Norwegians congregate in droves to attend a festival which is taking place here in Fagernes, devoted to this incredible culinary speciality. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> “You eat, then you thought avalez a glass of aquavit,” explains Havard Halvarsen, local firefighter full time that called “Rakfisk General”, responsible for the management of the festival. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> Around us, the people of swallowing small pieces of fish and enfilent a large quantity of drink. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> “Some people prefer aquavit on rakfisk”, adds Havard. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> The drink kills the smell. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> I try a few pieces. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> If you can avoid the pass under your nose, this is not bad – it is reminiscent of a sushi who have spent long hours in a bus. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in barriques water jar in the air, then salé in autumn. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> Then, during the winter, a time of fermented fish is out-and no doubt with the sense of diminished by alcohol-eaten. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians have been forced to leave their country to find work emigrating, mainly to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> Now, the population is growing rapidly-more than 13% of immigrants, attracted by the full employment, high salaries and a comprehensive health system. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> The swedes, their old rivals, whose country was not so long ago that most rich Norway, crossing the border to get work. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> The rakfisk is regarded as something important, a vital element, although odorant, past Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> This is the most expensive dishes. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> But everything is expensive-a pint of beer or a sandwich you will cost €10 each. </seg>
<seg id="2026"> Norway does not often speak of it in the international news, which is not to upset him. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> Here, people are not prepared to talk of Anders Breivik, the racist right-wing extremist who killed 77 people, including women and children. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> When they talk about this killing, they talk about “the incident of July 22 .” </seg>
<seg id="2029"> The Norwegians were hard to accept that their country in peaceful, one of their own could commit such an act of barbarism. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> “Oil is not the single reason for our success,” explains Anna, our barmaids, blonde hair and the eyes of a blue transperçant, the image of the Nordic welfare, with a plate of rakfisk in hand. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> We are – how do you say – people cautious. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> His English, like that of most of the people who live here, is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> We are silent, we do not like us out. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Norway has managed its oil wealth carefully-all, with the exception of a small percentage of money from the industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> When other countries laid money around, over the years that have led to the international financial crisis, Norway has managed to keep its purse tightly. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> “As long as we can skiing in winter and make the trek in summer, we are happy,” says Anna. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> “Without forgetting the rakfisk”, add in a carefree laugh. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> I am standing in the snow and I am queuing to buy any food-I had my dose of rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> On the menu, a hamburger composed of momentum, a real discovery, is excellent. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> The hotel where I am staying is one of many places where it serves the rakfisk for dinner and where we can vote for the best of them – or perhaps the odorant more of them. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> There is a tv where the interviewer, wearing a bow-tie, surrounded by tables of rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> You would think the Eurovision contest. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> “What attracts you gave the best fish, in the mountains Thor-Juergen?” </seg>
<seg id="2046"> “This is our points, Havard.” </seg>
<seg id="2047"> We hear the laughter and applause. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> A man falls to his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> Or perhaps it is because of the fumes of fish. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a difficult start. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> While the incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take office in Mexico, Will Grant, of the BBC, is interested in the challenges that lie ahead and the expectations of the people, who are numerous. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> Traffic to Mexico is particularly bad at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> In a city where the traffic jams are legion in normal times, a barrage of security has been in place since Monday, blocking several key access roads in the capital and causing a real chaos on the roads. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> Nevertheless, the goal was not to prevent people from going to their work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching the House. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential sash to become the new president at the head of the nation. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> A complicated task ahead. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Mexico&apos;s economy is doing well, the results must be the outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already claimed the lives of around 60,000 people in six years. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> “My government has made the commitment to the mexican people to reduce the violence,” said Mr. Pena Nieto to President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Before alongside the US President, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the state of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> A state very populous and sprawling gripping the capital. on his land favourite, opinions are divided on this new leader. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> A man direct </seg>
<seg id="2063"> In the joint bucolic del Valle de Bravo, for example, it is etched in the memory of all. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> The local to attribute the development of tourism and infrastructure in the joint. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> To join the city, you can take a new highways of Mr Pena Nieto, a significant improvement was made on these roads, once bosselées and full of crevasses. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> The plates bearing his name are hanging outside of a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> “We are counting on him to implement lasting changes,” said his friend and political ally Olvera Gabriel Hernandez, a member of Congress and the party of Mr Pena Nieto, the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> In terms of security and economy, we expect real change that our country desperately needs. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> After 81 years unwavering in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> The member of Congress Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are a lot of expectations within the party on Enrique Pena Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> It rejects the criticism from opponents who blame the new president of lacking charisma. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> This is a man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> This is an excellent statesman and, above all, he knows to listen. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> However, this is not always the image that people have of their former governor. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> In Nezahualcoyotl, also known by the name of Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more conspicuous. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Hidden beneath the autoponts motorways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And the problems in the City are also practical and urban. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Earlier in the year, the military has been called in to fight the drug gangs operating in the districts, and violence against women are particularly serious. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> In a disaster zone was found, on the edge of discharge, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the last two years. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico, while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a rate far higher than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez-a place notorious for the number of innocent women who have been killed. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> Critics of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that at best, it has failed to stem the problem of murders perpetrated against women when he was in office. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to see the reality. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> In a house in concrete, typical of this ramshackle neighborhood, Irinea Buendia fight to retain his tears when she shows me pictures of his dead daughter, Mariana Luna for. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> The official version of a committed suicide by Mariana in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> However, his family believe she was killed by her partner. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> “When I arrived home, it seemed to me that his body had been washed,” recounts the Señora Buendia. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and rigidity cadavérique was already taken. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> When his mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana dresses the wall, alongside a cross that features the word: justice. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> However, that is exactly what the family was denied. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> The authorities have treated me as if I was an old commère, a fautrice of disorder, a pleurnicheuse. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> They want that we accept what they say and we remain silent. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> “But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions,” she said. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> When President Pena Nieto will receive his scarf on Saturday, it will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Tens of thousands of families have been affected by the crime in Mexico during the last six years, and the new president has promised that he would do his priority during his tenure. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> “I hope it will be as good as chairman when he was governor,” said Olvera, Valle del Bravo, a member of Congress. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> However, that is exactly what the families of victims of Ciudad Neza fear most. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> Bradley Manning has not complained of mistreatment, say prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of abuse, including Bradley Manning have been in custody. </seg>
<seg id="2099"> The trial is on the detention of Manning in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> The defence wants to classify the case on the grounds that the kidnapping of Manning is in extremely difficult conditions. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents. </seg>
<seg id="2102"> Prosecutors have tried to show, Friday, that the file against Private Bradley Manning — accused of being behind the biggest leak of confidential information in the history of the american military — has missed many opportunities to complain of abuse he claims to have suffered during his military detention. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> During a cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, the Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein said that recordings made weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, have revealed any complaint about his treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> The counter-interrogation — during a hearing, the defense has presented a petition demanding that the case be dismissed on the grounds that Manning sequestration is in very difficult conditions and was a harsh enough punishment — took place a day after that Manning has demonstrated its desire to kill himself during his detention. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> During the hearing Friday, Fein has examined Manning forms that officers had met after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in a military prison in Quantico, where he was subjected to a maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2109"> Officers have asked questions to Manning and have recorded his answers. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> When Fein has mentioned the forms, Friday, Manning has acknowledged that the treatment they have reserved its guard was “excellent” and that the treatment he had in the prison was generally “very professional.” </seg>
<seg id="2111"> The forms are no complaint for bad treatment, although the officers have directly asked about his treatment prison, Fein said. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> Manning replied that he had verbally expressed concerns about some of the problems and that the officers visiting had discussed his concerns and said they will occupy, but they have not recorded the issues raised. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> “They have written “no problem” (having addressed the concerns), and so did not mean that I had not raised problems,” said Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> The military judge Col. Denise Lind, also asked why Manning was not complained about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special committee which met to discuss the suicidal thoughts that he had expressed by writing a few months earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to change its status restrictive indicating a “risk of injury.” </seg>
<seg id="2116"> The military said they had assigned this restrictive status — a level below the close surveillance for risk of suicide — for his protection and the safety of others. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> “I wanted the staff know that I was going well, and I wanted that to be cut this statute … in order to enjoy a better quality of life, from my point of view,” said Manning. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> Manning testified Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and its transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison on the basis of the body of the Marine base at Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> He said that he had considered suicide when he was in Kuwait and be gone once because of the heat. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> He added that the fact of not having been kept abreast of what would happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very frightening. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> “My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, in the cage,” said Manning, on Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> I thought I would die in the cage. </seg>
<seg id="2123"> Once at Quantico, Manning said he had spent most of his time in a small cell — at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours — without company. </seg>
<seg id="2124"> Manning has also added that the only objects he had had a mattress, a blanket, tongs, clothes and his glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> He has tried to stay in motion, because sleep or stay extended during the day was against the rules. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> Manning also said that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in the eyes, lit outside his cell. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> If the guards did not notice his face when he gets back on the night, they wake up to see his face. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> The lawyer of Manning has made a formal complaint to the treatment of Manning in January 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> Manning has been placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> Also on Friday, the judge asked questions to Manning on an allegation reported in his testimony Thursday — after having been forced to sleep naked all night in his cell at Quantico, has been forced to stand naked before the guards and other inmates one morning during the appeal. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> Manning has testified that at no time, he has been allowed to cover themselves with coverage during the appeal. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> During questions to the judge, Friday, Manning said he attributed to his guards that he had to relinquish its coverage that could hide his nudity, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to leave. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked last night, because he tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> Manning said to the officer that he could use the elastic of his underpants or its tongs to be injured, but that it had not done so. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> That night, Manning has testified that his underwear, his tongs, and his glasses were taken out of his cell. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experience he has experienced during his detention and that it will significantly reduce her sentence if he were convicted in a court martial, a trial that is expected to take place early next year. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> The defense has said that Manning intends to plead guilty of crimes less serious and fight for the abandonment of other charges were considered too extreme. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> The hearing will resume this weekend, with prosecutors who should argue that the conditions of detention were justified. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> The Pentagon has confirmed that Manning has been incarcerated under regulation which governs the detention conditions of all detainees at Quantico. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> The charges against Manning include the theft of goods or public documents, collusion with the enemy, resulting in the publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information relating to the national defense. </seg>
<seg id="2141"> If all the charges are included, it faces a criminal sentence of life imprisonment. </seg>
<seg id="2142"> My american identity crisis-mexico </seg>
<seg id="2143"> He said that many have been forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to blame those parties; they remind the Mexicans difficult periods, he said. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Navarrette says that the Mexican-Americans find themselves caught between two worlds. </seg>
<seg id="2146"> During a recent trip to Mexico, arriving in the hall, to the customs and immigration, I felt lost. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Signs indicated two paths: one for “Mexicanos” (“Mexicans”), another for “Extranjeros” (“foreign”). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I stayed immobile for several seconds, not knowing what to whip me direct. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I grew up in central California, where I have been called the “Mexican” all my life. </seg>
<seg id="2150"> It is a derogatory ethnic, in the same way that my friends in Boston, use when they say “irish”, or my friends in New York when they say “italian”. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Then I became “Mexican-american.” </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But, here, it was Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> And, on the land which saw my grandfather, no need to “special or bridge. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was simply an American. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak spanish well enough to manage an interview in one or another language. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But I do not have the vocabulary of an indigenous, and I cannot lose my american accent. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> Then I took my american passport and I am heading to the leading “Étrangers.” </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I thought at the time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the President Obama, to the White House. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> Usually, when the leaders of the two countries meet, their favourite subjects are immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans to stay in Mexico rather than risk to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> It wants to join the United States and Canada, and create a Union for trade on the model of the EU, but in North America. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide more details. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and embittered. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans have probably never thought that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to surrender by writing half their territory to the tip of the gun. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But for the Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, not minutes, the memories are everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> Therefore, whenever an official U.S. formula the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear — in the mexican press, and among the elites — complaints about the way the Americans are undermining the sovereignty of their neighbour. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the children of Montezuma seeking the brawl. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> And yet, for Mexico, the relationship more difficult is that the country has with the more than 35 million in Mexico-Americans living in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> You want that addresses the issue of bitterness? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> There are many. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for which the country cannot offer. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> The only reason the large number of ancestors in mexican cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio, at a given moment, in our family tree, someone, perhaps a parent or a grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and has had to go in the North. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> And the more often, this person was a profile type — a dark-skinned, poorly educated, from a poor village, etc. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> Not Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> And even if we are living the american dream, that we went to good schools and we have good situations, we should never forget that it is the american dream that we live, and not one of the Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> We attach to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> Furthermore, we know that part of the elite mexican among the ruling class, we do not like. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> The feeling is mutual. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> We remind them a humiliating defeat and they are facing each other down as if we were individuals of lower strain and not sufficiently disciplined. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> Our spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> For them, our existence is synonymous with failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never parties. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> And we do not end up stuck on the right side of the fence, living comfortably in the United States, but as souls lost. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife who was born in Guadalajara and legally emigrated to the United States when she was a child, remember that there is friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, because the Mexicans demanding more firmly their identity and the Mexican-Americans are angry. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> Although she is a US citizen, it has the feeling of being part of two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> Furthermore, many Mexican-Americans I know did not appear to be part of a country or another. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We worship music group the Mexican Los Tigers del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in any of the two. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico, we see as Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And in the United States, we regard as Mexicans. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> And now, to complicate the relationship, as I discovered during my stay, some mexican leaders and part of the intelligentsia want to be closer to the diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want the Mexico-Americans working as ambassadors of fortune for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We have to explain to our fellow Americans that Mexico is a beautiful country that we absolutely must visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Yes, of course. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> That will not happen. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> There is too much bitterness. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And, if we consider the inequalities in pay, corruption and violence linked to drugs that are pervasive, many of us are not persuaded that it is a fantastic country. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> You are going to have to fend for themselves, amigos. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> This is normal. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they have dealt with Mexico a century and a half, they must therefore accept that some Americans in Mexico-they want always the way members of their family have been treated not so long ago. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Hmmm. </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps we are more “mexican” than I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> Old quarrels, new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a setback for peace. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Will it ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such hope is vain. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> While still the same arguments futile to know which began, dozens of buildings have been reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza have landed near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But although the Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in flux. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> The Arab Spring has everything shatters, and like it or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught up by the regional upheaval. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps that their fight is even more. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> However, there is every reason to think that this could help to break the deadlock. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> A war which is no winner and no loser </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first sight, it seems difficult to be optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November continues, the fighting this week have reinforced the supporters of the force, on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007, targueront have forced the Israelis to abandon, even if Gaza has suffered a kicking. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Having killed some of its leaders and removed the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most impoverished and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel has not managed to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their rivals Fatah, the more moderate palestinian faction. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Moreover, the leaders of Hamas might say that time is their ally. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> The influence of Islamists in the arab world is increasingly strong, and Hamas has friends of the rich and powerful. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Turkey, a regional power booming, once the closest muslim ally of Israel, has sided with Hamas; like Qatar, one of the richest states and most dynamic golf. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> Hamas members glee and say that the growing Islamist to curve around Israel from Lebanon, in the north, where the Hezbollah militia exerts its domination, via Syria, where the rebels to islamist trend can topple Bashar Assad, and Jordan, where the allies Hamas threaten the king. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> And most important, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and most central arab countries, has changed the balance of the region. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, the dictator who ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> By contrast, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders are banking on more accessible to the public. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In the future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as a player of importance which cannot be ruled out even by America and Israel. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> During this time, the hardliners of Israel draw opposite conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> In military terms, Hamas has been challenged in the box. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The missile interception system called Iron Dome has proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles were destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> The Israelis will be able to sleep on their two ears – for some time. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many european countries have criticized the Hamas to be the source of the latest wave of violence. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> But above all, Israel has thrived, particularly under Binyamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who has totally ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Although the rockets from Gaza have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared by the suicide attacks, including the separation barrier which encroaches on the West Bank, the main chunk of what could be a palestinian state, and which protects the jewish settlements continue to expand despite their illegal in international law. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Mr. Netanyahu, whose party likud party has merged with a more hawkish Avigdor Lieberman, the leader of the approach of the election on 22 January, the hook. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Why coddle these indicative Palestinians in giving them a state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If they ruled the West Bank, do they not launch rockets, as their countrymen have done to Gaza? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> It is better to keep them behind the wall and the strike as soon as they leave the head. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Perhaps that hardliners prevail; but it may be that the Arab Spring is changing. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Even if islamists taking power in Egypt and elsewhere like little Israel, their priority is to tackle problems in their own countries. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> The defence budget of Israel is more important than its four arab neighbours together. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> Start a war with the superpower local does not help the new Arab governments to fix their economies. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire which bodes well — and could mark the beginning of something. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> The Israelis should also look to the future. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> With the rest of the Arab world, which is becoming more democratic, deprive the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is doomed to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel-a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> The crackdown has already weakened democracy in the jewish state, demographics and exacerbates this problem as the Arab population increases. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to stop Hamas have a price on the diplomatic level. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> The two sides need to be driven by those on the outside. </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The answer remains the one advocated by reasonable people that each side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of land by Israel in exchange for security. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> A little hope, and in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give the opportunity to those outside of defending this cause. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Egypt, which must now work to stop the flow of arms to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a jewish state in the 1967 borders with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> The arab countries should also be external pressure on Hamas and Fatah to join. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> This would contribute more to the creation of a palestinian state as the next proposal of a pseudo-state at the UN. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Mr. Obama also has an interest in what Israel agrees to negotiate. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first term, he has not presented its own peace plan. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Back at the White House, it seems equally unwilling to establish one. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> This is a very narrow vision. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The stability of the Middle East is vital for America. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> This involves a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2260"> The laws for packets of cigarettes neutral came into force in Australia </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Warnings and photos of bodies sick cover the dark green packages that are all identical, whatever the brand </seg>
<seg id="2262"> The law came into force in Australia is a world first, logos and colors have been replaced by a dark olive green and horrific pictures of diseased organs and representations of children and babies whose illnesses were caused by smoking parents. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> Outside of different photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the name of the brand, printed in small print on all packages. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> It is the regime the strictest in the world on packaging of tobacco. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> The australian federal government has declared that the aim was to deter young people from smoking by removing any representation glamour. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> Studies have shown that if people do not have started smoking before the age of 26 years, there are 99% chance that they will start ever. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> “Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image,” said the Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies which have shown by example that children associating the crown logo to a princess.” </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Although Australia has the lowest rate of smoking in the world and if these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The tobacco industry has lobbied against this law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> Tobacco manufacturers have said that to boost trade on the black market, which give easier access to cheaper cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> “Adverse consequences flow from this legislation,” said Scott McIntyre, British American Tobacco Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Counterfeiters in China and Indonesia will sell many more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Others have said that this law had boosted their activity. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the request, to cigarettes, including silicone to mask the horrible packaging, has greatly increased two months since that british American Tobacco, Britain&apos;s Imperial Tobacco and Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco have challenged the law and lost at the High Court of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> Ha said Zico has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting renewal of stock. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> For us, business is good. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> The only problem, say the experts, is the popularity of social media and the tranche of people targeted by the plan. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> After a series of australian law prohibiting advertisements on tv, sponsorship of sport and the requirement for dealers to hide cigarettes, the marketing of tobacco is now available online. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Australia has banned advertising on the Web by businesses and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign Web sites to do. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> “If you work in the marketing of tobacco and that you have more than a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the key par excellence,” said Becky Freeman, a researcher in public health at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> Freeman has noticed an increase in contributions of some ordinary citizens in favour of brands on social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> We must ask whether it is just a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who has bothered to make a video, or whether it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> British American Tobacco Australia has said that the industry focuses on the new regulation in force rather than on marketing. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> The industry has gone to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to contest these new legal decisions, these countries have declared the who that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries has significant trade with Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> A WTO decision should be taken in the year 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> Plibersek said that the Government had held discussions with other countries with similar laws on packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Canada was the first country to make mandatory the photos of warning on the packaging in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Now, these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> The tougher laws are currently studying in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> The photos do not bother me. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I know. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> “You take a cigarette and you delegation the package,” said Victor El Hage when buying a package which included a photo of cancers of the mouth. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> To be frank, the only reason I will stop, it is my girl. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yu, manager of the “King of the Pack tobacconist” in the centre of Sydney, said that the uniformity of packaging made it hard for the overhead bin packages on the shelves. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> “First, I needed an hour to unload a parcel, now it takes me four hours,” said Yu. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> “The government had to ban them, once and for all, and we said ok, that is good, it stops and you put the key in the door,” he said, lifting his arms. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> In a world constantly connected, it may be worth bothering. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> I spent five hours in an airport during the period from thanksgiving because our plane had mechanical problems and we have to wait for the arrival of another plane. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> Therefore, I have had time to reflect on the subject of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I am not going to lie. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> Spend half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not forgetting the shops of duty-free). </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But increasingly, some academics and experts in child development praise of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> It is perfectly normal for us and our children-with Europa from time to time, they say. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> This will force the brain to borrow the interesting, or even to feed creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> And as we are, for the most part, constantly to several types of screens, we do know the benefits of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> Then we should welcome the boredom with open arms? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And not. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> But I will return. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> First of all, like many people, I thought that boredom is a fairly recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, Professor of Greco-roman history at the University of Calgary, in Canada, and the author of “Boredom: a Lively History” (Yale University Press, 2011). </seg>
<seg id="2313"> “The problem goes back very far,” he said. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> On the walls of Pompeii include graffiti latin evoke the boredom, they date back to the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> Then there is the definition of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood aggregate, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> Having travelled many publications and submitted the idea to a group discussion of approximately 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have defined boredom as an experience that is “trying to do something, but without engaging in an activity satisfactory.” </seg>
<seg id="2318"> What differentiates the boredom of apathy, he says, is that the person is not in the process of undertaking a task well as it would like. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> With apathy, he says, there is not the appetite to do something. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> What is at the heart of the problem, he said, is “the interruption of the process of attention, associated with a low mood and feel that time passes slowly.” </seg>
<seg id="2321"> The trouble can strongly resemble a depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> But Professor Eastwood said that if the two may be linked, people who are bored tend to think that the problem is the environment or the world, while the depressed people believe that the problem has them. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes we think we bored when it is in fact a matter of concentration. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In their study, “the Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of care”, which was published in the journal Psychological Perspectives is “science” in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have highlighted an experience in which the oldest participants listening on cassette, the voice of a person reading a magazine article. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some groups have heard, from the room at his side, too high a broadcast tv who had no report, others have just heard the emission of tv, and the third group has not heard the band-its. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> Those who have heard the tv to a low noise level said they were more annoyed than the other two groups, they have had difficulty concentrating, but did not know why, and attributed the problem of concentration to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> When you try to concentrate on a difficult task or stakeholder, an interruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark I. Fenske aggregate, a professor of neurosciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> However, when you are doing a boring task, “like watching objects on an assembly line, music can help you not to bore you.” </seg>
<seg id="2329"> In fact, he says, we now know that when tortille or griffonne, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are in fact a good way to stay physically more alert. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> “Studies have shown that children who are allowed to learn more watching and retain more information than those who are forced to remain without moving,” said Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> We are all bored one day-late for my flight plane, a user with a voice lacking in sparkle, a film, particularly annoying. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But some people are more prone to boredom than others. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> To measure this, researchers have developed a “scale of predisposition to boredom” in the 1980s. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> The scale includes statements such as, “among the tasks that I carried out, many of them are repetitive and monotonous,” and “I have so many interests that I do not have time to do everything.” </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Using a scale, the researchers found that boys tend to be boring more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need of stimuli many and varied. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But in general, teenagers are quickly blase. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor in individual development and Community at the University of Illinois, has conducted an experiment in which he has contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times per day via a beeper. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> It found that 32 percent of teenagers claimed Europa at school and during their duties at home, while 23 percent said Europa when they were not at school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> In contrast, 3 percent of parents have said is boring. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Professor Larson said he did not know if the percentages of boredom of today, 21 years later, would be higher or lower. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But he added that he knew that “adolescence is a time when boredom reached its highest level”, especially because children and teenagers do not have much control on what they want to do. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> If I ask my question: boredom is it good for you? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, this can cause people to take physical risks absurd, make bets or abuse of certain substances to pass the time, as studies show. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> In contrast, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the problem for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> “The trouble is the way that the brain has found to let you know that you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the N.Y. U. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate thing to do. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If you ennuyez and use that energy to play the guitare and cook, that make you happy. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But if you look at the tv, that make you happy in the short term, but in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> So if your child is bored and you give it an iPad, it is ennuiera more, but it will not have learned to deal with it alone and autorégler, says Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> And “this autorèglement passes from one situation to another,” he says. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Your child learns not only to entertain, it gets more control of himself in other areas. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I do not think we should glorify boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> Just as I do not believe we should criticise. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Feel comfortable outside the “constant that generate the activities and the technology is the goal towards which we should strive. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Eastwood agrees on this point. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> “We need we bore more often, but boredom arouses acute manic and a desire to be connected to something that makes sense,” he said. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> According to him, what the people want, this is a way to disconnect and appreciate the time of arrest. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> “In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulés,” he added, “it is difficult to find ways of engaging in something when the noise stops.” </seg>
<seg id="2359"> In Colorado, no directive for the new law on marijuana </seg>
<seg id="2360"> Anthony Orozco, 19 years, in a university student and football player in Colorado, is indicted for something which will soon become legal in his state: regard the possession of marijuana and a pipe used for smoking. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> Mr. Orozco said that one day, in September, he and some friends were aboard a car at Lamar, in the middle of the field, close to the border with Kansas, when they were arrested. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After that the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco has received a citation to appear for possession of drugs and material used in its consumption-minor crimes, each with a fine of $100 and a date of appearance. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> “We are treated like criminals,” said Mr. Orozco. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But is it? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> During the weeks of uncertainty that followed the vote of Colorado for legalizing the use of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving a low drug use depends more on that instead of the law. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana were classified. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> The police have continued to prosecute adults 21 years or more for minor possession of marijuana, because the law will come into force in the coming weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But the prosecutors who are more conservative in the constituencies of Colorado have called to accelerate the business of existing marijuana and continue to prosecute people who possess. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time, several towns in the suburbs of Denver up to the mountains of the West now vote to prevent the opening of shops selling marijuana, approved by the state in their neighborhoods. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> “Things are changing so rapidly that I do not know what the future holds,” said Daniel J. Oates, the chief of police in Aurora, Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> Regulators in Washington State there are also plenty of questions. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They are in search of directives on how to install a system of permits, allowing them to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell-before the deadline of 1 December 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> They say that Colorado, like it or not, is ahead of most states in terms of regulation on marijuana, firstly on the use of therapeutic and now with regard to personal use. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> “Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator,” said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But no place or system, acknowledges Mr Smith, cannot do more than suggest what works. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> “There is no real precedent on which we can build,” he said. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The law in Washington, which is called I-502, takes effect on 6 December, which leaves a gap of a year, during which the system permits will always exist, whereas the possession of marijuana is legal. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> Meanwhile, practical questions remain unresolved: how to balance the mandate of the state which ensures adequate access to marijuana licensed and bans the installation of shops selling cannabis in a radius of 30 km around a school, a park, a playground or a crèche. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> “There will be no more difficult places that urban areas to install a trade approved sale of cannabis, particularly in the metropolitan area of Seattle,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman of the centre of legalisation of cannabis, a research group recently formed. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> On 21 November, the police chief, Oates, Aurora, has sent an e-mail to its officers, announcing that the “City” US Attorney (representing the public prosecutor) will pursue more people 21 years and who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should stop to charge people for this type of crime “with immediate effect.” </seg>
<seg id="2381"> The Chief Oates said that the police will apply the new court decisions that regulate the activity of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to pursue drug traffickers and dealers. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the “district” US Attorney (prosecutor), Ken Buck, embodies a vision more strict. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote, he said that his office would continue to deal with cases of possession of marijuana, mainly in order to put pressure on the users that they should kick. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> Currently, 119 people are accused of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are the subject of other charges. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> “Our office has the obligation to bring proceedings against those who have committed a crime, at the time of the offence, was recognised an infringement,” said Mr Buck. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The reactions have been complicated, even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters have rejected the initiative for the limited use of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, is no longer appear adults for possession of small amounts. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> The representative of the public prosecutor in the county, Pete Hautzinger, has supported the decision, but has also decided not to classify without following all the affairs of possession of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> “I have the impression of not waste my time to continue to enforce the law until it changes,” he said. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Although 55 percent of voters in Colorado have supported the measure, provide a legal framework and governmental appropriate personal consumption of marijuana is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> And contradictory reactions that have been observed in various american cities, highlighted the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> “It is a cultural barrier” with representatives of the public prosecutor, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of consumption of marijuana and speaking as spokesman of the local “National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana laws (national organisation for the reform of the laws on marijuana). </seg>
<seg id="2393"> “They have spent a good part of their lives to prosecute those who used marijuana, also, are they hard to accept that this is legal,” he said. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> As the first states to deal with the limited consumption of marijuana at the same level as that of alcohol, Colorado and Washington state are becoming a case of jurisprudence for the legalisation of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> While advocates and representatives of the state for a new frontier of legalised sales, they are waiting with concern the directives of the federal government, which still sees the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> Advocates of legalizing marijuana, hope that the Ministry of Justice succumb. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Despite some high-profile arrests of patients under marijuana therapeutic and sellers, the federal government has allowed the shops selling marijuana for therapeutic purposes to exercise in Colorado, Washington and in 16 other states. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> If it is true that the police will probably not take down the doors to take small bags of drugs, it is highly likely that it opposes licensed shops selling marijuana for personal use is permitted by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Many cities of Colorado did not wait for federal authorities to act. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Even before the vote, some local authorities have approved moratoriums on the creation of new shops selling marijuana, even if it is only a delay of a year. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week, the town of Montrose has obtained a moratorium of 6 months, and should enforce the ban next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> “We do not want to find ourselves in a situation where a licence is granted to someone and then we end up with a federal problem,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our community has voted against the amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> We are interested in voting for the community rather than the vote of the state. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> A lot of questions arise. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Petronella Wyatt: I have been bullied and excluded Oxford, because I was a “Tory” (conservative). </seg>
<seg id="2407"> It is not just the students of today who are attacked for their opinions. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> As far as I can remember, I have always dreamed of going to Oxford University. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> My father and my older brother have studied in what was, for me, a prominent place, a sort of Greek University lecture theatre of modern times which stimulates the two pillars of civilisation, free thought and tolerance. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> However, two weeks after being installed at Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to make my suitcases, causing the first scandal of my life. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> My father collapsed and started to cry. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> My friends were puzzled. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> The newspaper the Evening Standard has claimed that I had left the university, because I had objected to the fact that students from the first round had sexual relations in the bedroom next to mine. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> The author A.N. Wilson said with quirk that I was part after being forced to drink in the cups ébréchées. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> The truth was less funny. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> I have fled. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Yes, I have fled, because I had been a victim of intimidation and the subject of constant bullying. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Not because of my name rather extreme, or due to the fact that I had a private school. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> I have been persecuted for a single reason, and in this cradle of supposedly know, I have been a victim of racist behaviour and barbaric: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was an influential aide to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> Why mention this today, I hear you say. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of students of centre-right suffers the same type of persecution. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> The growing hatred and institutionalised Tory students at Oxford is such that last week, some of them have demanded a protection of their rights as those of gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> Conservative members of the Chamber of students (JCR) of Corpus Christi College said they were “often isolated, attacked personally and felt unwanted” because of their political views. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> They want a representative on the committee of the university for equal opportunities so that their opinions can be freely expressed. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Their situation has not been helped by the recent documentary on BBC Two called “Wonderland: Young, Bright and the Right” (“the Wonderland: young, Intelligents and Right”), dedicated to the policy among students, and painted a graphic picture “tories” as eccentrics and neo-nazi. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> We found it was particularly student Joe Cooke, a former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA),” which moves in Rolls-Royce, displaying a complete silver and moves with a cane to head chromée. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> In other universities, students say conservatives be treated as scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees.” </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Luke Black, 20 years ago, vice-chairman of the “Nottingham University Conservative Association,” said in a newspaper on Sunday that “there is a bias left growing in universities. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> People think we are as the Bullingdon Club without even having encountered.” </seg>
<seg id="2430"> Samuel Roberts, 21, a student in history at Corpus Christi, who has proposed a motion for more protection, said that such a climate is “uncomfortable”, and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years, president of OUCA, said that there has been a deterioration of the attitude of the JCR towards people who are centre-right. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> “This is an obstacle to the freedom of debates, intellectuals and the welfare of members,” she said. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> I was the only one to think so during my first weeks at Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> I came in September 1986, I was then aged 18 years and a paralysing shyness. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> Hatred of the Conservative Party was very fierce. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> Last year, the university had voted the refusal to grant Margaret Thatcher-a former student-an honorary title, because of the reduction of the funding of higher education. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> The atmosphere was charged with vibrations stalinist. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> From the first days of the week, when the new students have seen with other teachers, and I had a foretaste of what will happen in the future. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> I discovered that the teachers not only attended the sarcasm toward students Tory, but they are taking pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> It was as if the policy on minors strikers, privatisation and the Government&apos;s opposition to sanctions against apartheid South Africa was etched in wood from classrooms. </seg>
<seg id="2440"> The first ludicrous I encountered was a translation into English of french texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> “Miss Wyatt,” said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), “please translate the first paragraph” </seg>
<seg id="2442"> I have lost. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Pitt, a small man to face pustuleux, won easily. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> “The Thatchéristes refuse to learn french, or are they just stupid?” he asked. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> The other students laughed. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> The tears me burning eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> “I suggest you take french classes for your free time, finally, if you are not too busy you make friends”, he launched a truculent tone. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> I am back in my room, inconsolable. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> At the dinner that evening, I am sitting alone and then I felt a slight tap on my shoulder. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> It was a student in second year of studies English, appointed James, who is presented as a member of the OUCA. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> “I know who you are,” he said, gently. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> I am afraid that it is. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> Anyone suspected of being a Tory (Conservative) is targeting. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> It is already hard enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, it will be even harder for you. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Most of the young Tory claim to be Labour (Labour). </seg>
<seg id="2456"> Later, at my local pub, I cravenly tried to hide. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> I have insisted on the fact that I did not agree with everything that had said Mrs Thatcher. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> This ploy failed. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> A student in first year of philosophy, science and economic policies which, ironically, had studied at Eton, said: “Tu es, the daughter of a fascist pig.” </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You are contaminated. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Other students have taken up the refrain. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I was corrupted, dirty. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> “How the Tories do they love?” asked one of them. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> They hit each other, is it not?” </seg>
<seg id="2465"> I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> I have only able to lead a normal life in Oxford? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> I have been forced to meet people who share the same views just after nightfall? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> Should I have become Labour and disown my opinions? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> The next three years would resemble a purgatory of ostracism and isolation. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The only Tory was openly Professor Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who taught in my university. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> He was detested not only because he was a conservative, but also because he was a foreign policy adviser to Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> It was almost never there. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> He hated this place provincial and trivial, and its accession to the point of view entirely deterministic Marxist-history. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> In 1997, he accepted a post as a professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> “You cannot not be happy here,” he said. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> I have begun to shuttle between Oxford and the house of my parents in London, finding refuge with my family and my friends dwellers more open mind. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> I told my father that I hated Oxford and I explained to him why. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> It was disbelief. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> During his studies at Oxford, in the 1940s, all the political points of view were accepted. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> “It is the best place in the world,” he said moving pleas. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> They do not do it, not in the city of spires dreamers. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Even my friends communists had impeccable manners. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> He had tears in their eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> Gives them a chance. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> I am sure this is to goad. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> This would break the heart if you leave Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance has gradually deteriorated. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> A friend, also Tory, has succumbed to the pressure and has renounced its beliefs. </seg>
<seg id="2489"> During a session of tutorials the following week, when another professor of history suggested the more seriously, that I was “an enemy of the people”, I have decided to do so. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> Blushed internally of shame, I have agreed to be a victim of the brainwashing of my parents and the old traitai “crazy”. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> The respite was short-lived. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> It was my father who drove the final nail in my coffin oxfordien. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> At that time, he wrote two columns in the press of Murdoch each week. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> My door was locked. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> I was cowering in my room, and after five minutes, my persecutors have abandoned. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> When they are gone, I have done my suitcase and I took the first train to London. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> I am never returned. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> You can treat wimp pleurnicharde. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> But no child of 18 years should be a victim of such intimidation in a school setting. </seg>
<seg id="2500"> The tragedy is that it was Oxford, which not only has produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also enjoys an unshakeable reputation of equality and freedom of thought. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> “Designer Valentino phoned prefers elegance to the publicity” </seg>
<seg id="2502"> In the context of the exhibition “designer Valentino phoned: a Master of Couture”, which opened this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other customers of the famous italian fashion. </seg>

<seg id="2516"> Even so, it is a star. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> Valeria Mazza, wearing a designer Valentino phoned model </seg>
<seg id="2518"> The Argentine, catwalk model Valeria Mazza, has not forgotten the charisma of fashion. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> Years ago, after a parade in Spain, in Rome, we went to dinner in her apartment. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> We were a dozen people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr. </seg>

<seg id="2523"> “It will never happen, because his creations are works of art,” finishing it. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> Procession line of nobility </seg>
<seg id="2525"> The life of Garavani is not a history of obsessions but love shared. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> He loves the people of high and with the most headlines and they love it too. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> One of the galleries of Somerset House was converted into a podium glamour of 60 metres wide which proposes swap roles: the visitor takes the place of moons and must go on the podium to admire a “public” dream on the main creations of designer Valentino phoned, as the tailor that Jackie Kennedy had chosen for her marriage to Aristotle Onassis, the suit that was Monica Vitti in “La Notte”, or a wool and fur coat belonging to Empress Farah Diba. </seg>
<seg id="2528"> Among the public of moons, names such as Luxembourg, Gloria Sybille von mail-coaches and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario Bulgaria or Sophia Habsburg. </seg>
<seg id="2529"> Naty Abascal and fashion in 2006 </seg>
<seg id="2530"> Many of its customers saying that the first clothes designer Valentino phoned are like first love, “impossible to forget.” </seg>
<seg id="2531"> I remember well. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a life jacket “gillette” and a jacket of the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> “It is a gift that it had made me,” said Naty Abascal, one of the muses of fashion. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> “I prefer to all the others for their femininity, his love of women, and because our sublime beauty,” adds the former Duchess Feira. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> I love the colours he uses, they are clever and illuminate the face. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> The proportions are perfect. </seg>
<seg id="2537"> The Princess and Patricia modeuse della Giovampaola of Arenberg cannot forget, either, the first time that it has been a model designer Valentino phoned. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreams of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his dresses for the evening … </seg>
<seg id="2539"> Finally, this was possible in the late 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> I bought my first model designer Valentino phoned for a party in the house of my cousin, Prince Eduard of Line. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> It was an evening dress in red, with a skirt to flying, a draped bustier and a up their fall. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> “It was a dream come true,” said the widow of Rodrigue of Arenberg. </seg>
<seg id="2543"> “Designer Valentino phoned is indifferent to fashion, it is obsessed with the timeless,” explains the aristocratic italian who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires. </seg>
<seg id="2544"> The Princess of Arenberg retains the robes of evening of fashion with “the utmost care, because a dress in the evening is not just a dress, it is also all memories of that vehicle.” </seg>
<seg id="2545"> The “King” of fashion </seg>
<seg id="2546"> The grand final of the exposure of Somerset House is the dress of married Marie-Chantal Miller scope during her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2547"> It took four months of work and 25 “ragazze” (the fashion item and its seamstresses) to achieve this dress in ivory silk with incrustations of beads, twelve different kinds of lace and a trailing four and a half metres. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, supreme authority of the press, this robe represents an historic high styling of the end of the 20th century, “the return of customers of the high society.” </seg>
<seg id="2549"> Obsessed for years by the “knowledge” of the nobility, designer Valentino phoned is now his best representative. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Commandeur, of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the legion of honour, Garavani aggregated all honours that any husband of its customers. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> “His sophistication, his calmness, his aspect treated and perfect, I have always jumped in the eyes,” recognizes Arenberg. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> The last time I saw it, it was a month ago at a dinner to the Museum of Orsay. </seg>
<seg id="2553"> He was sitting at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends. </seg>
<seg id="2554"> “He was impeccable, the years have no effect on him.” </seg>
<seg id="2555"> If it is a princess who said … </seg>
<seg id="2556"> The hardest job in the world: the human mules Kawah Ijen </seg>
<seg id="2557"> For four euros, the carriers of the indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health in 70 kilos of sulphur through trails of stone slopes. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> There are people for whom the work is hell and others who work literally in hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of 400 minors who earn their living on sulphur Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the indonesian island of Java. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> It must work every day until the bottom of the crater, where the sulphuric gas from the bowels of the earth is solidifie on contact with the air. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> After having reaped large rocks of sulphur, which weigh a total of 70 kilograms, it develops in the two baskets in bamboo that burden on his shoulders through trails slopes. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> There are only 250 metres until the high volcano which peaked at 2,386 meters, but carriers exhausted put more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a rate of turtle, bearing the balance and measuring their not not to stumble and fall into the abyss. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> They know that one false step could cost them their lives, as happened to a french tourist who took a fatal fall in the Ijen volcano Kawah several years ago. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> The miners Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> Once on top, we find a path between the tourists that the photograph as if they were animals of circus, and painfully heavy baskets, they walk the 3 miles until the balance that a mining company has installed a little below to 1,850 meters. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> It is about PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company which operates the volcano since 1960 and, you might say, its employees, to which it pays indonesian 662 rupees (5 cents) per kilo of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> It then sells to 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry since the ore is very present in everyday life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and serves to whitewash the sugar. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> “As we move around 70 kilograms, we earn approximately 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip,” explains Anto, which operates in general three trips per day. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> All it takes 3 hours and it ends up, but it allows him to win 138,000 rupees (11,50 euros) at the end of the day. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> Although this may appear to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, is triple what it gained in the fields. </seg>
<seg id="2571"> “The income of minors is very high here, where the harvest coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (1,20 euros) per day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),” says the carrier who once worked as a builder on the tourist island of Bali. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> There, his salary was $75,000 rupees (6,20 euros) per day and the job was not too difficult, but Anto income is close to his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is also indisputable that sulphur: “I have married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have reduced to Java for it to converting to Islam.” </seg>
<seg id="2573"> Anto suffers from asthma, breathing with difficulty, constantly coughing fit and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> For 27 years, he spent three of his life to defy the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulphur has already begun to make him pay the bill although it covers his face with a mask and gloves special. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> Anto suffers from asthma, breathing with difficulty, constantly coughing fit and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases emitted by the volcano. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> That is the price he must pay to pursue his dream. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> “I am going to work another two years, because I want to open a shop or study spanish or french” promises in an English more than acceptable. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> Hurt by life, this young engaging and intelligent could be tourist guide, server or receptionist in a hotel, but, instead, it is the work of a donkey. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> It shares a masure timber grubby with other carriers, rose every day for two hours in the morning because the sulphur does not cease to discover the night, when its distinctive blue and yellow colour becomes shines amid the darkness. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Defying the dark, Anto descends into the crater in illuminating with a small lamp set to his helmet, that he has bought himself with his own money. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> Some 400 carriers loaded the baskets of sulphur on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> Despite its hefty profits, the mining company has not mechanized mining of sulphur to save costs and provides no equipment for carriers who work on their own and are paid to weight. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> Moreover, they do not affect either under 30,000 rupees (EUR) mark by camera, in addition to the entry of 15,000 rupees (1,20 euros), that the guards of this natural park charge to tourists who come for photographing the volcano and its human mules. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> “This work is done for the animals, not humans,” protest Madrusin corpulent, a bearer of 42 years who works at Ijen Kawah for 30 years, since he left the college. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> Capable of making up to 110 kilograms, it ensures that it will not stop work “as long as he can,” because it needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18 years. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> I will not take my retirement, I will die here because the volcano is all my life. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Although the sulphur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the tide is turning and trap the miners in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardened that nobody complains to suffer serious illnesses … and of course their usual respiratory problems, arthroses, pain in the knees and shoulders, distorted by the weight of baskets. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, aged 53 years, can only charge 50 kilos. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> Each day, his companions and extracting 15 tonnes of sulphur volcano, three lorries transporting the warehouse Tamansari, 18 miles away by a path of goats invaded by weeds. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> “I would not take my retirement, I will die here because the volcano is all my life,” says Unainik opening of the mouth, revealing several teeth missing. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> The eldest of his five children, aged 30 years, also works as a bearer of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Time passes, but the misery continues from generation to generation, one of the most difficult jobs in the world: what do the human mules volcano Kawah ljen. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> Singapore research babies to save the economy </seg>
<seg id="2594"> The Singapouriens lay the blame for this lack of children on the career, the stress and the cost of access to the property. </seg>
<seg id="2595"> “The population of Singapore must develop.” </seg>
<seg id="2596"> I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, fulfilling our civic duty and give life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It may seem implausible that these words come from an advertising of pellets mint, but despite this, or perhaps because of it, the video spread like wildfire on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The words come from a group of rap, which uses local references as “going to put a bag in the drawer” to mock the birth rate of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hope to draw attention to the problem of fun through advertising. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of the music for the people to fulfil their “national duty.” </seg>
<seg id="2601"> It is intended solely to the Internet, we could therefore make it entertaining and fun. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> It is the main problem in this country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, and we felt that it was an issue that we need to address. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government had tried several things like perfume launch the phéromones or organise evenings of speed-dating. </seg>
<seg id="2605"> Many of these ideas were creative, but they do not necessarily have worked. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> So we said the following: what&apos;s more creative to solve this problem in a rap song? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 children </seg>
<seg id="2608"> The government of Singapore will not take so lightly. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> It spends $1,300 per year in policies to encourage its citizens to have more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> A measure of the government in favour of marriage and fathers providing up to $15,000 per child, longer maternity leave and distributes profits tax. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But this has had little impact. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a city-state rich and high technology of south-east Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national distribution of population, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time it was above 2, considered the renewal rate, it was in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> Why the Singapouriens not have more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Tan Wei Ming, Director of policies of marriage and the family division of the national population, says that this is due to a “better education” and “a wider choice of career opportunities.” </seg>
<seg id="2617"> “This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond the marriage and the family,” explains it. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of unmarried and delaying marriage and the birth rate, which has led to a drop in the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, an immigration policy to increase radically immigration to counter the decline in the population has created a resentment among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore, they find Web sites that moves a barely disguised xenophobia against the new immigrants, especially the Chinese who are accused of shooting down wages and not to integrate. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The increase in immigration is also seen as a reason why the party in Singapore last year has experienced its worst election result since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Irreversible consequences </seg>
<seg id="2624"> While the falling birth rate has known effects on economic growth, tax revenues, the health costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also has unintended consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> The government is trying to prevent the construction of many small houses. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> For example, it has started to affect the real estate sector. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> The authorities of urban development began to control the number of small apartments, known as the “shoe box”, can be built in certain areas of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> These flats have an area of 46 square metres and their sale wins much success. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> However, the authorities are concerned about the fact that they can promote a lifestyle of single and discourage developers wanting to build large family homes. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yew Soon, director of the real estate company El Developers, states that its “boxes” shoes to sell much more quickly than the larger houses. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are more popular, in the sense that these houses are built much more rapidly than those of larger. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> For this reason, it is more profitable for our cash flow. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> However, he admits that the new standards provide clearer guidelines for developers, who was previously a spanner in the works if they wish to offer too small in a housing project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too much stress </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is a city-state. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> If these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the birth rate, in discussions with the Singapouriens who work in the financial district of the centre, it would appear that they do not have much effect. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> “People are very stressed out, houses are expensive, like education, that is why people call it later,” says a young framework. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> The other people can have children. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> “But for me, it is important to have my money and my time,” says another young for 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> Men and women cite their career, the stress and the cost of access to property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children. </seg>
<seg id="2641"> Thus, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies are Singapouriens themselves who have the last word. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> What is private offline is private online </seg>
<seg id="2643"> Confidentiality </seg>
<seg id="2644"> According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy Spaniard, it is the quality of the private sphere, or “the field of privacy that we can protect any intrusion.” </seg>
<seg id="2645"> What is this – which is private for less than 16 years? </seg>
<seg id="2646"> How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks? </seg>
<seg id="2647"> Understands the dangers posed by broadcasting on the Internet of events that he does not share offline? </seg>
<seg id="2648"> The newspaper elPeriódico asked five young boys, aged between 10 and 15 years, frequent users of the web. </seg>
<seg id="2649"> In four of the cases, they associate the term “something very personal” on a personal level and “the password and user name” when they have applied to social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> “I do not dévoilerai my personal secrets in a post,” says Jorge, ten years ago when he tries to explain the meaning of the term private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where it has an account for two years. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> “These are secret very secret, my mother can know them but not the whole world,” he says. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> On francs, I post images sympas or games. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> I discuss it with my friends. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> “I do not share one of my photos or someone who is stupid,” he said. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> The boy recognises that it is wrong to publish lewd photos, people dénudées, crimes or write comments humiliating or violent. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> Jorge ensures that he knows his friends on 35 francs and its nine subscribers on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> The majority are family. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> His mother in part, she knows the password to one of the accounts. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> I have opened a twitter account to speak and write tweets interesting. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> “I do not know if they will meet the post, I just,” he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> “Social networks are fun, I can speak with parents or distant with my friends, so quick,” he said. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> He says that he would never accept the request to a person unknown. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> It will not trust to someone that he would recommend a foreigner. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> The case of José, 14 years ago, is different. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on this last, admits he does not know 20 people included on its list of friends. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> “It does not worry me because we have something in common, music, for example,” he says. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> According to the boy, nobody has made advances or asked for her address or phone number. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> “If they gave me the pressure or demanded, I simply supprimerais my account,” he acknowledges. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> José is subscriber to Ask having read a recommendation on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> The experiences that we know today under the name cyberharcèlement are not foreign to the boy. </seg>
<seg id="2671"> A friend of a friend of mine has been extorted money from on a social network. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> They have threatened and demanded money. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> “It has never knew who it was,” assures it. </seg>
<seg id="2674"> The victim, according to José, has not closed its account. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> “It has only happened in private profile.” </seg>
<seg id="2676"> Then he explains a series of manipulation for arranging his account of how safe. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> Unlike Jorge, this young posterait photos of knowledge in situations uncomfortable or embarrassing. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Yes, I would do it if I was angry or excited. </seg>
<seg id="2679"> “Even if I know that it is the cyberharcèlement”, he says. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> Key questions </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Marielos Porras, professor of English and sacked in education and learning, consider that, for children and adolescents, we must understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> “The Internet has created as a means of seeking information, but with the appearance of these sites, the rule of the game has changed,” mentions it. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Porras says that the academic Marc Prensky, who has a master&apos;s degree in teaching at Yale University and author of the book “natives and digital immigrants”, uses those words to explain the phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> The digital natives, they are children and young people who are born with the technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> “We, the digital immigrants who must teach them, while we ourselves to learn,” she said. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> It adds that the issue is complex, “because we ask them to have a defined criteria on what should or not to disclose, to publish or saying at an age when they do not have the maturity to do so.” </seg>
<seg id="2687"> “We ask them also to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, of having thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences” to add. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the expert, the most effective way to teach the confidentiality to children and adolescents is using the questions which are sobering. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> “Their say not to count for nothing,” she says. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Then, Porras lists a few examples: there are things that you do not raconterais to a foreigner, why do you on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, as you like it to publish a photo of you as a friend that you have published? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> You know what others publish on you? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> When you identifies photos of Christmas, requests you to other people permission to identify them? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And also, does the world need to know that you make every moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> Another point is to make them understand that they must act in line as they do offline. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> These are the same rules. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> “Outside of the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, this must be the same on social networks,” she says. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Surveillance </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and adviser for education, says it is essential that parents read carefully the terms of use of social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> By understanding each of the words they have solid foundations to discuss with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> “By example, age and what it is allowed to share or publishing,” he said. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> According to Guardia, it is essential to remember the children not to talk to strangers. </seg>
<seg id="2703"> The summit of the Unasur ended without the Lima Declaration is made public </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) has ended today in Peru without the declaration Lima has been made public, although it has been previously announced and theoretically adopted by the seven trustees present. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> Efe has tried repeatedly to access the document signed during the sixth Reunion Ordinaire Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the presidency have said initially that he would be released after the conclusion of the summit, and said that it would publish a moment on the website of the peruvian government. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> When they were asked about the text, they have indicated that its content was exposed by the president of Peru, Ollante Humala, during brief statements to the press. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> The journalists&apos; access to information about the summit has constantly been limited. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> During the day, only the video without his House presidential with the message “private session, audio restricted” was distributed in the press room. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> The little information circulating among the journalists have been given by the press officers of some governments Unasur that attending the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> The single document leaked during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some disquiet among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media demanding more important news. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> Later, the president of Peru has sent an e-mail to the media with the “final statement” of the summit, but it was the speech of President Humala and not the official document which has reached the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> Last October, Peru has been the host of the 3rd Summit South America-arab countries (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although it has been asked with body by the press, he had not released the statement also called Declaration of Lima, as had been previously announced. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> On the official website of the ASPA, we can check that the document was published in March. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> In the two international meetings, the peruvian authorities have tried to put in place systems of transmission is safe for all journalists, but they have limited the maximum obtaining information. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> The Summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court in the Hague that settles a border dispute between the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the rendezvous regional and have said they would respect the decision of the ICJ to hear the pleas of both sides in the trial that Lima has instituted against Santiago, which starts Monday in the Hague. </seg>
<seg id="2717"> “We respect and leave the verdict which will resolve the disputes that we have today in this international court,” declared President Humala, alongside his chilean counterpart. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> “Chile has always been, and will continue to be a country that abides by international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international courts,” added President Piñera by giving a handshake to President Humala, alongside the flags of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> The confirmation of the two presidents that they abide by the ICJ took place after that Colombia has denounced the pact this week in Bogota by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of the international court, after a decision on the maritime limits with Nicaragua regarded it as seriously flawed. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Hugo Chávez in Venezuela, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> Paraguay, suspended Unasur for 2011 after the impeachment of former President Fernando Lugo, has not participated in the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The host, President Ollanta Humala, was instructed to open the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The trustee has read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of 31 projects were set between the south american countries for a total of 17 million dollars of investment. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the Unasur countries put in place “important steps to achieve the aim of the south american citizenship by the development of agreements on residence permits.” </seg>
<seg id="2725"> He informed that action would be put in place to improve the “cooperation in the fight against insecurity and urban against international organized crime, campaigns for better access to medicines, access to the Internet at low prices in the whole of South America, and to assess how effective joint and the risk of natural disasters.” </seg>
<seg id="2726"> With Europe in crisis, “economic consolidation (Latin America) should not have a matrix triumphalistic but should help to increase our matrix productive and to see a better future for our people,” concluded the President Humala. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> “We have decided to put a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of areas of South America, especially in rural areas and border … between our countries and generating new economic cycles,” said the peruvian President during a speech. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> Among these projects, he mentioned that five were Peru and were on the routes across its territory, from the coast up in Brazil, and that two were a greater connection with Ecuador, although it has not given further details. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation of Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> “We hope that the electoral process in this country will return within the Union of South American Nations”, of which he is currently excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> The need that America remains a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another topic at the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> In this sense, the colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, said before the meeting, that he hoped to meet his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico City to discuss the dispute maritime calmly through a judgment of the ICJ requested by Bogota. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> “It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,” declared President Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> “We will review all these routes, they are not comprehensive, including the treaty with Nicaragua will ask to have a discussion with this country,” he said. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> “I hope to be able to say to President Ortega that we will resolve this in the most civilised and friendly as possible,” added President Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> The presidents Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico City, where they planned to attend the takeover of the new President, Enrique Peña Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Similarly, in the framework of the summit, the bloc&apos;s defence ministers meet to approve the plan of action of the year 2013, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defense in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Venezuela, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although that country to be suspended. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Peru presidency acting of the regional bloc. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> “South America needs to learn how to integrate Europe citizenship,” says Rafael Correa. </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which “South America, in this case, to take on Europe”. </seg>
<seg id="2742"> President Correa, who has participated in the sixth summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, said on state television, tv Péru, the Europeans were “smashing the Second World War” and other conflicts, “but that they were now almost a homeland.” </seg>
<seg id="2743"> In this sense, he defended the project to establish a south american citizenship, encouraged by the member countries of the Unasur. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> “It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any latin american country, as is already the case for members of the Community Andine, but there are still areas reactionary that we want to belong to the past,” he warned. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> In addition, Ecuadorean President showed for the restoration of the Organization of Americans States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon and take into account the signatories of the pact in San Jose on human rights. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Those who bombarded us will never compromise, conversely, the south american, have all signed. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> “It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington under the financing of the United States,” he said, referring to political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa ensures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself has not betrayed its principles, but instead it met its “deep democratic values and human rights.” </seg>
<seg id="2749"> He concluded that, at the time, “there were suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country, and that his trial will not be respected.” </seg>
<seg id="2750"> It criticises the swedish court which has demanded that it be put on its territory to questioning about an alleged sex crime while “own swedish legislation enables us to do by video, which could be for the Embassy of Ecuador in London”. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa said that there was a risk that the mental and physical health of Assange is deteriorating. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> “I have not spoken to him since he is in the embassy, but the ambassador has informed me that he had a small problem lung, but nothing serious,” said Ecuadorean President. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> It is possible that his physical and mental health is deteriorating by the fact of being locked in a small area without power do exercises in the open air. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> “This is about the health of anyone,” he concludes. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Correa says that the solution to asylum granted to Assange since June in the ecuadorean embassy in London, which would be a safe-conduct which would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and european judicial authorities and it stresses that it has had discussions in London in order to find a solution to the detention of the WikiLeaks founder. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> “The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and european judicial authorities because the lawyer for Assange, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a series of procedures to various european bodies,” he said. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And he believes that “if Britain granted the safe conduct tomorrow, it would end.” </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if Sweden, as it allows all its legislation and, as it has done in other cases, asked Mr Assange in the embassy of Ecuador in London, or queried via Skype tomorrow, the problem would be solved. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa has benefited for reasserting itself as a defender of the freedom of the press and he has stated that it will not tolerate “the mediocrity, bad faith and lies which damage the freedom of expression.” </seg>
<seg id="2761"> “The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not politicians malicious or perverse but bad journalists in the pay of greed, blackmail and extortion,” he said. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In this light, it is happy that this is not that kind of journalists “neither bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois who dominate in Ecuador” and, instead of putting forward his re-election, “it would increase the revolution to continue the path and draw the right path.” </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Correa has also supported the decision to maintain the ban on Paraguay within Unasur, at least until the next elections, arguing that the agency “should be firm and does not tolerate the opportunism and the attempted coup disguised” because, in reality, “this destroys the legitimacy of paraguayan democracy.” </seg>
<seg id="2764"> What is more, Ecuadorean President as “perfectly appropriate” the desire of his colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundary between the two countries through the judgment from the International Court in the Hague, which will strengthen maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> For the moment, this judgment is not respected. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> It is a problem between a country South American and Central American countries. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> The conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overtaken by the desire to move forward together. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> We must solve them in their entirety to overtake them and move forward. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> At the same time, it has said it is confident in the positive resolution of the dispute over maritime borders between Peru and Chile in the same court and he said that “it is good that the America understands the international courts if the two countries agree to accept a judgment so firm that it is.” </seg>
<seg id="2770"> In reference to the possibility of its presentation as a candidate for future presidential elections in Ecuador, to run for a third consecutive term, he reported that he saw this possibility “with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult.” </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Correa has ensured that, if he loses the primary in February 2013, withdrawing from public life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> On a personal level, I was never interested but in situations as unfair as those of Ecuador, this poverty socio-economic can be resolved only through the political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> “My political movement believed that it was me that guaranteed this possible victory but we must accept this responsibility,” he said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> If I gagnais, this would be my last presidential term and I then withdraw from political life. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> If we lose, I will. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> “It is my decision,” he said. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Correa has also made reference to the new medical treatment of the venezuelan president, Hugo Chávez, to Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> I have to discuss with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that a routine medical treatment was already planned and that he expected the end of the campaign to return to Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> “It is not a relapse of the state of health of President Chávez,” he commented. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> The Head of State Ecuadorean participated today in Lima in the sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which ended with a call for greater regional integration in order to support the progress, equality and security. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> AIDS-related deaths are today due to a late detection. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio was 21 years old when it was confirmed the result of the test: HIV positive. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> “It is as if the sky has fallen on the head,” he says, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make “less embarrassing”, in vain. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> The young man has hidden in his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> He decided to take care of his illness and has started to inform his subject and his stubbornness has been such that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> It is, without doubt, one of the oldest patients of the unity of HIV hospital civilian Guadalajara (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Fabrizio living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubts, little choice of treatment and stigma. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> Even then, the director of a clinic of the IMSS avoided him “because he was speechless.” </seg>
<seg id="2789"> At that time, AIDS was synonymous with death. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> However, ignoring their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, “exhausted” their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> 31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in every case, after the first cases reported, “the great victory is today that the survival of a patient began treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same,” said the head of the unity of HIV of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and it takes for reference that this information has been validated in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> The infectiologue and expert in HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depends on the level of the immune system that showed patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those do not consume drugs: up to 30 years for a rate of CD4 200 and up to 50 years for those reaching a rate of 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Put simply, this means that for someone who receive a diagnosis of HIV positive in 25 years, “as long as it remains under control, can live without problems up to 75 years,” explained the scientific questions. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> To put this into context, we need to know that the life expectancy of mexican is now 76 years on average. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> If it is true that the death rate has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of deaths from AIDS is past 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the annual report from UNAIDS), but it is also true that, since the appearance of AIDS, 60% of patients registered on the national database died. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> Nothing in Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and it had 187 deaths until May this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs is universal since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> So why is there still deaths? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> I think that the problem is not with the access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> That is how I see it, which is what happened in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> Over the past 12 years at least, we have never lacked for drugs, the problem is that patients are very advanced stages because they do not know that they are infected, or they learn in the advanced stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> It gives us an indisputable fact “nine in ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, it needs to have a greater impact on the overall mortality, make diagnoses more early and, for that, we must offer screening tests on a massive scale, to all those who request it.” </seg>
<seg id="2803"> Experts and members of the State Council of AIDS prevention of Jalisco (Coesida) agreed on its proposal, as the patients themselves, as Fabrizio, who has done his screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done and that, despite his young age, he was already infected with AIDS and was suffering from Kaposi sarcome of a cancerous tumour, which is the usual complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some believe that they will die and do not want to know. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> “If I will die, it is better that I broke three times per week,” they say, this is not my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medication. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> To this day, his parents know only that it suffers from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I have a normal life, like anyone else. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> “I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but I am involved, attention to me and to the other person,” says Fabrizio, who has agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO for help, thanks to his testimony, those who fear today, during the march of the World Day against AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> What do the test, if they took risks, they will know soon if they are HIV-positive and the better, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that they can live like everyone, being responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> His message sums up the slogan of the battle against AIDS in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Condoms on the desk </seg>
<seg id="2814"> There are many gaps between the health programmes and the ordinary citizen, supports Ricardo Salazar, journalist from Guadalajara who has embraced the cause of HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And the biggest lies in prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In all the places dedicated to this, “we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we gave one or two, now gives us packages of 100, is all very well, but it means that, even today, some do not have access to condoms,” he says. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> Among the most vulnerable to the new infections, found adolescents. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> The question: “what are you going to do?,” asked with ludicrous and value judgments by social workers, guidance counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers do not want to hear, ensures the journalist. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> It proposes to redirect this inefficient distribution; that condoms are not only sold in the shops, but as we find them in the distributors of public toilets, and in places that frequent the young. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> This is not to encourage promiscuity. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> It is not their pay girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio Gonzalez had responded when asked whether there would be a distribution of condoms in its administration. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> “This is not how it works, sexuality, the best is to provide condoms for people already sexually active,” he said. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> The figures in Jalisco </seg>
<seg id="2824"> There are 13,435 case cumulative (12,158 1,317 of AIDS and HIV). </seg>
<seg id="2825"> The state is the fourth state in the country by number of new cases and cumulative AIDS cases and 13th for the number of sufferers of HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> 92% of infections are by sexual, 6% by blood and 2% by post. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, since for every case recorded, there are 4 or 5 people that ignore. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> Ratified in a judgment call by a United States court ignores the debt restructuring of the group Vitro via a voluntary bankruptcy trade in Mexico, the scenario creates a dangerous precedent for all companies with national ramifications in the neighbouring countries and solvency problems. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> It seems, therefore, that the procedures of the survival of companies allowed by the mexican laws are not valid in the country at the spangled banner, opposite view of international agreements. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> From a practical point of view, the blow to the ruling on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, leaves the mexican companies without a defence against the possibility of embargo their properties beyond the Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2831"> However, the resolution will allow the main manufacturer of glass of Mexico before the Supreme Court of the United States based on three inconsistencies. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> First, while the judge of the case indicates that creditors should register in the bankruptcy law in the United States, the court of appeal of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings is bankrupt commercial formalized in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2833"> The first would be to denounce the cooperation of international procedure in the event of insolvency of transnational companies having a profile. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> In fact, the Model United Nations uniformity of International Law trade had been created for this purpose in the American Law Institute as a referee. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> Secondly, the judgment states that without the vote intersociétés, recognised in the critical mass to bankruptcy, trade debts incurred by Vitro subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not be obtained. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> However, the mexican laws recognize this possibility. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, which the Federal Institute of bankruptcies trade had guarantees the debts. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> Furthermore, what is certain is that, since it was the votes of the subsidiaries, in all ways of Vitro creditors who fought against it in the courts of the United States, that is to say the “vulture funds” as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, does not have a majority. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> The vote was 45 votes to 37. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> A fact omitted by the court of appeal. </seg>
<seg id="2842"> On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he encountered since 2008 without stopping to the serious economic crisis that confronted the United States, passing on the costs to the country. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> For the moment, the society of the family González Sada interjettera appeal before the same court of appeal for the vote to take place in its entirety, that is to say, with the five judges, since only three had voted. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> The use of insurance required non-prosperity and requires the revision of the trial by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> The most serious is that the court has ignored a document sent by the government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae (friend of the Court”) in which was detailed the procedure followed by Vitro within the framework of the law on corporate bankruptcy, suggesting that the freeing of agreements signed by the two countries to reach the same level as paragraph 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> In addition, he points out that the country has bowed to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, which is to say the rules set out in the event of insolvency, which ensure fairness for debtors and creditors. </seg>
<seg id="2847"> Carambolage of two parts: they overwhelm Vitro and they overwhelm the country. </seg>
<seg id="2848"> General stock </seg>
<seg id="2849"> The complaints of unions Society Mexicaine aviation against the ex-boss of society, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, were overlooked for several months, he was accused of fraudulent administration, the trade union pilots Aviateurs has already encountered problems. </seg>

<seg id="2867"> Héctor “Hetin” Reyes “the basketball is all my life” </seg>
<seg id="2868"> The globe-trotteur of basketball “Hetin” Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in connection with the ground and, thanks to him, has travelled the world. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of the local basketball as large as that of Héctor “Hetin Reyes.” </seg>
<seg id="2870"> The reason is that before a stroke will condemn the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes has been immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, be it as a footballer leagues below, player of the national team basketball, manager and leader of the national team, BSN, with the vaqueros of Bayamón or as president of the Federation of baseball. </seg>
<seg id="2871"> “I have brought several hats in the basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was chairman of the BSN, director of the national team and president of the Federation during the 1990s,” recalls Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora home in Bayamón, where it lies with Isabel, his loyal wife for more than 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> “The basketball is all my life.” </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Reyes does not exaggerate when he made that statement. </seg>
<seg id="2874"> The walls of his house, almost all receiving pictures and memories that remind her itinerary outside standards, show. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> Bayamón in the heart </seg>
<seg id="2876"> For all his memories, those he loves most are those who recall its passage as a player in the team of vaqueros in the mid-1950s until 1982, having spent 15 years as co-manager and manager of the team. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> “This has been my best years, those I have most benefited because I have had the chance to participate in the vaqueros eight championships from 1967, either as a manager, co-manager or leader. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> For many years, including the five championships played from 1971 to 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> I then withdrawn during the championship in 1981, the year when Jerome Mincy entered the team BSN. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> From there, “Cuco” Ortiz, who was a great administrator, has been leading the team,” says Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2881"> I remember that Gene Bartow, who had been leader here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: “I have a player strapping for you, it measures two metres. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> You want?” </seg>
<seg id="2883"> This is how to begin Mincy, one of the best players that had Puerto Rico. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> Bartow was then recommended Raymond Gausse, which has been naturalised and which was a better shooters. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> I remember saying that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon win a championship, Gausse would help us try to win another. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> He welcomes the championship of vaqueros with Gausse, but only at a distance since 1988 it was already the largest manitou Federation. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> In that time, he preferred to take advantage of its burdens and Mincy in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> I remember when we won for the first time in the United States during the pre-olympic tournament in Mexico in 1989. </seg>
<seg id="2889"> Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived Fourth and where we should have won the bronze medal if the judge Canadian we did not play the last match, said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> The team of the 1990 World Cup is the best national team that you have a view? </seg>
<seg id="2891"> It is one of the best, like that which has beaten the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> But my favourite is the Games Panaméricains Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and we have put a kicking to the team of the United States, which was quite similar to that which won bronze at the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> This team not only was composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and “Piculín” (Ortiz), there was also the young (Javier) “Toñito” Colón and James Carter, the brothers Francisco and León (Edgar) and Mario “Quijote” Morales, who had not seen the world of 90 because of a knee problem. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of individuals, but it has given us a gold medal and a great joy at the tournament pre-olympic Neuquén in Argentina. </seg>
<seg id="2895"> With players like “Canito” Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner replacement players suspended by the bungled the Games Panaméricains of Mar del Plata, we have won gold against all the forecasts. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> What has been the best player in Puerto Rico? </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Without doubt, it is about Piculín Ortiz. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> Its statistics at the level of international tournaments are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculín. </seg>
<seg id="2900"> And this without taking into account its trajectory in different leagues, for which he has played. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> That was the best leader portoricain? </seg>
<seg id="2902"> It is very difficult to say. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> We had a good team of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres. </seg>
<seg id="2904"> In the young, I very much like the work that fact Leo Arill. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> For you, what is your biggest success within the Russian Federation? </seg>
<seg id="2906"> Having been part of the time the most glorious of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the BSN mattered until 17 teams in a season. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> You are there to do? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There are things that I wanted to put in place, as the regionalisation of minor categories. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> For example, that boys of Pontius play only in their area and face only teams from other parts of the island in the play-offs. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Today, young people travelling and playing too, while this is not strictly necessary. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> I have at least given the advantage of qualifications and compulsory courses for the leaders, staff on the ground and the referees. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> That makes me happy. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> What do you do today? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> In general, I listen to music, I watch the clips of my time on YouTube, I take my grandchildren and, from time to time, I attend matches basketball. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> And of course, I take the company of my wife, Isabel, who was always at my side. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> Death of actor Larry Hagman </seg>
<seg id="2917"> Larry Hagman, born September 21 1931, the Forth Worth (Texas), was universally known by the main role of John Ross Ewing, known as J.R., in the television series “Dallas,” in which he embodied a heartless, dangerous and manipulative. </seg>
<seg id="2918"> Larry Hagman, whose role of unscrupulous oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series “Dallas” became a symbol of the greed in the 1980s, has died. </seg>
<seg id="2919"> He had 81 years. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> Hagman, who was returned this year in the role of J. R in a new season of “Dallas,” died Friday evening from complications of cancer, according to a statement from the family sent to the associated Press for Warner Bros., house production of “Dallas.” </seg>
<seg id="2921"> “Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, again playing the role ironic that he loved the most,” said the family. </seg>
<seg id="2922"> The family of Larry and his friends were with him to Dallas in this holiday of thanksgiving. </seg>
<seg id="2923"> Linda Gray, who interpreted the role of his wife in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, said her press officer, Jeffrey Lane. </seg>
<seg id="2924"> He brought joy to all those who knew him. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and it will greatly miss. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> “This was a person of exception and he lived life to substance,” Gray said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> Doctors had diagnosed with a liver cirrhosis to Larry Hagman in 1992 and he acknowledged having much engrossed for many years. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> In 1995, he had detected a malignant tumour in the liver and he underwent a transplant. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> Years before “Dallas,” Hagman had been known to television in the role of a type normally in the series “Jinny of my dreams” broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970. </seg>
<seg id="2930"> In it, he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is transformed when he found a genius alluring, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and he brought it home. </seg>
<seg id="2931"> He also played in two comedy which remained little time on the airwaves, “the Good Life” (NBC, 1971-72) and “Here We Go Again” (ABC, 1973). </seg>
<seg id="2932"> Among his roles in films are well received by the critical roles in “the Group,” “Harry and Tonto” and “Primary Colors.” </seg>
<seg id="2933"> But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of such a nice way loathsome J.R. that Larry Hagman enjoyed his greatest success. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> The dramatic series of CBS on the Ewing clan and their relatives has been broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991. </seg>
<seg id="2935"> The slogan “who shot J. r .?”, invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotions, in which the character of Hagman is almost murdered, has generated speculation in the world and millions of dollars in betting played. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> Thanks to that, among others, the series has reached a record audience for that time. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers averaged before their screen and “Dallas” the second programme of entertainment, the most watched in the world, after the final episode of “MASH” in 1983, which brought 50 million viewers. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> It was the sister-in-law of J.R., Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) which had taken over. </seg>
<seg id="2939"> J.R. had put pregnant and had subsequently threatened to accuse prostitution if it does not leave the city, but other people were also reasons for the attack. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable but the smile: a charismatic entrepreneur dishonest and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic interner wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray). </seg>
<seg id="2941"> “I know what it is like funereal action for J. R,” Hagman said in 1988. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> We should write “Ci-is the honest citizen J.R. Ewing.” </seg>
<seg id="2943"> Here is the only part that he has lost. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> Victoria Principal, coprotagoniste of the original series, has mentioned this Friday to Hagman as a man of “immense, both on the screen and in life.” </seg>
<seg id="2945"> He is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, to millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each of us, who have had the chance to know and love. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Ten episodes of the new edition of “Dallas” was broadcast a few months with great success on TNT. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> The registration of five episodes is already over for the second season, and a sixth is underway, has informed the chain. </seg>
<seg id="2948"> For the moment, neither Warner nor the chain TNT have reported on how the death of Hagman in the series. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> From Fort Worth, Texas, is the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who was acquainted with the celebrity works classics as “South Pacific” and “Peter Pan.” </seg>
<seg id="2950"> Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave him the day in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman. </seg>
<seg id="2951"> He made his first steps on the scenes of theatres in New York in the early 1950s, then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> It was there that he met the young décoratrice of internal Swedish Maj Axelsson and he married. </seg>
<seg id="2953"> The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the californian city of Malibu resident, where many celebrities. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> In 2001, he called his memoirs “Hello Darlin”: Tall (and) Absolutely True Tales about My Life” (in french: hello Darlin”: the memoirs of ruthless I R.) </seg>
<seg id="2955"> “I have nothing in writing this book that can injure somebody or affect anything,” he told the press at the time. </seg>
<seg id="2956"> After his liver transplant, he became an active campaigner of organ donation and working as a volunteer in a hospital to attend the patients concerned. </seg>
<seg id="2957"> “I would advise them, I give them confidence, I have with them when they come to operate and after” recounts it in 1996. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> I try to offer some solace, like “Don&apos;t be afraid, it will not be easy for some time, but it will go well.” </seg>
<seg id="2959"> He has also been activist against tobacco and has participated in several campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="2960"> In a reference to the “end of the world” has just begun </seg>
<seg id="2961"> Each week, students explore the apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, the zombis, viruses and germs and climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> This semester, when Professor religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a lecture on the end of the world, he knew that he was casting an irresistible bait: the end of “high estimate” of the mayan calendar, on 21 December, which refer to many people as evidence of the end of the world is imminent. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> But Professor Charmé had no idea what the expected during the following months: Hurricane Sandy disaster, a fiscal abyss that some have dubbed the “own Armageddon of debt” and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christians theorists of the end of time believed that will trigger Armageddon. </seg>
<seg id="2964"> “I did not realize that this was going to be the most apocalyptic that I have never experienced,” said this week Professor Charmé her students of the Rutgers University-Camden (New Jersey). </seg>
<seg id="2965"> If you look at what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and the racontions, it has been a very good period. </seg>
<seg id="2966"> And it should be remembered that what is bad is good for those who believe in Armageddon. </seg>
<seg id="2967"> And he is not the only professor to give way on the “end of the world” this semester, which will, in theory, the last of history. </seg>
<seg id="2968"> At Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker exempts the current “Media, Culture and the end of the world.” </seg>
<seg id="2969"> Each week, students explore the apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, the zombis, viruses and germs and climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2970"> “We analyze it because these ideas proliferate with time,” he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guide some human conduct. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> If nuclear weapons fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> This month, the students analyse films with apocalyptic themes and learn how they can be compared with real-life examples. </seg>
<seg id="2973"> “I tried to tell my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible,” said Vacker. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania State, Professor of History of America and his colleague Matthew Restall Solari professeure Amara, a deputy of History of Art and Anthropologie, team to give way, simply entitled “the end of the world.” </seg>
<seg id="2975"> “We add “2012” to have the opportunity to give the course again, if the world does not go away,” said Professor Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2976"> Despite the “looming disaster”, students should study, create projects and spend their final examinations. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be spent the eve of the Apocalypse, which does not leave the student choice other than to work “until the night of the supposed end of the world,” said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2978"> The courts have proved quite popular. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> “It was complete in two hours,” said Restall about his current students at high level, composed of 35 students. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> We have received messages by email several weeks before the beginning of the semester, people who asked if there was still room. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> The students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> “It fascinates me to see what people are able to do for comfort,” says Bridgid Robinson, a student in sociology and religion of 23 years, from Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers University-Camden. </seg>
<seg id="2983"> Because fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is just a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> Will Wekesa, a student in psychology and sick bay of 25 years, states have watched all the apocalyptic films. </seg>
<seg id="2985"> “I had never heard of one who taught in this area,” he said. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> I appreciate it. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> But none of the students surveyed, and still less a professor said, do we believe in the end date of the world of December 21. </seg>
<seg id="2988"> “Our first project was the mayan prophecy, and somehow we have discredited,” says Julie zegle, student last year to Temple, aged 21 years and from West Chester. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> The Maya never predicted the end of the world, it is just a key date on the calendar, said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> But I admit that there is an anxiety linked to apocalypse in western culture, dating back centuries, which makes people respond to changes in their environment in predicting the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> The Internet has caused a rise of these speculations. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> “In other parts of the world, people do not believe in this,” assures it. </seg>
<seg id="2993"> It is a majority of the English-speaking world. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of the Salle which gives way to the Philippines this year, quickly responded when asked if he knew that we gave here on the “end of the world”. </seg>
<seg id="2995"> “The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world,” us-he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority. </seg>
<seg id="2996"> We have a pardon from the Pope. </seg>
<seg id="2997"> Restall remarked that, over the years, we have talked about the many dates alleged last judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on 21 December, “the people will immediately start thinking about the next date” or to philosophise about the fact that 21 December marks the beginning of a period of 7 years, at the end of which the world will disappear. </seg>
<seg id="2998"> The students and teachers take the date lightly. </seg>
<seg id="2999"> Several said they believed the Christmas go to “the end of the world.” </seg>
<seg id="3000"> “Sometimes I call friends and we rigolons together,” said Samira Ford, student communications in 20 years. </seg>
