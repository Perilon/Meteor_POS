<seg id="1"> A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama </seg>
<seg id="2"> The Republican leaders justify their policy with the need to combat electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, the latter is the Brennan Center is a myth, and confirm that the electoral fraud in the United States is less than the number of people killed by lightning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The attorneys for the Republicans have seen in 10 years in the U.S. only 300 cases of electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense, some of these measures will undermine the democratic system the United States. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In contrast to Canada, the United states for the conduct of the elections in the various states. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In this sense, the majority of the American governments since 2009, has announced new laws that the process for registering or the ballot. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon has gained in importance after the elections on November 2010, which resulted in 675 new Republican representatives in 26 countries. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, which restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new election laws require that voters present photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Moreover, these laws also will be shortened the time periods for the early vote, declared the law invalid, to register as voters on election day and citizens the right to vote, for which there is a legal acts. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the elections of 2006, no U.S. state has asked the voters to show photo identification. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Indiana was the first state, which has made such a request. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The United States Supreme Court in 2008 upheld the constitutionality of the law of Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The Republican authorities rushed to extend it to other states. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Over the last two years, in 34 states draft laws, which forced the voters to show photo identification. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that the U.S. citizens do not unlike Quebec on an universal ID card such as the health insurance card. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million vocal people no photo identification issued by a governmental authority of their state. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, five million Neuwähler in 2012 do not have such a card. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, are often more than a hundred dollars to pay in order to obtain the necessary documents. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The new restrictions are young people, minorities and people with low incomes. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years on the required photo ID. </seg>
<seg id="24"> This goes further. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The students who are seen as voters casting their votes for Democratic candidates in several states, it is not allowed to use their photo ID issued by the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="26"> On the other hand, allow the same States members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote for the Republican side, to use the cards issued by these associations for elections. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Before 2004, no state has called for proof of citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Arizona was the first state, who introduced such a request. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Since 2011 a dozen states have passed laws that require voters to prove their U.S. citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Clearly these measures are designed to limit the Hispanic votes. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Because it is clear that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In addition, Republican lawmakers have promoted 2011 in eight states have laws, doing away with the registration of voters on election day. </seg>
<seg id="33"> You have also restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who wish to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> These restrictions are not without consequences. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, the campaigns have contributed to voter registration in the 2004 general election to register some 10 million citizens. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Because the measures adopted since 2009 has reduced the proportion of registration of Neuwählern 2010 compared to 2006% by 17. </seg>
<seg id="37"> The Republican legislators in five other states have also adopted laws that aim to shorten the period for early voting. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida was 33% of the voters who elected in advance, African-Americans, even though they represent only 13% of voters in the state. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The same applies to the Hispanic population. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The latter was only 11% of voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance. </seg>
<seg id="41"> By contrast, the White, which represented 76% of the voters, only 46% of voters who voted in advance. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The Advocate General of the United States intervened to suspend the controversial legislation. </seg>
<seg id="45"> They could limit the damage. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 of the 34 states have laws that require the of a photo ID. </seg>
<seg id="47"> However, the new rules introduced in 2012, the exercise of the right to vote. </seg>
<seg id="48"> The democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the adopted laws and see them as a clear goal of influencing the results in the 2012 key states. </seg>
<seg id="49"> A report by the Brennan Center from 2011 shows that those states that have adopted these laws, which make up 171 of the 270 votes in the electoral college to win the presidency. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="51"> But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, some of these measures will undermine the democratic system the United States. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Prostate cancer screening: the test should not be made or? </seg>
<seg id="54"> In fact, the PSA test would sometimes incorrect results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions. </seg>
<seg id="55"> This leads to a greater reluctance of undecided women for screening tests. </seg>
<seg id="56"> The test should not be made or? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We have sought the opinion of two medical specialists. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In the studies conducted in the United States passed numerous confounding factors between the control groups, so that it is difficult to interpret this data and to give clear recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without detection. </seg>
<seg id="60"> This study has also shown that in a follow-up after 12 years, the likelihood of metastasized by 30% to 40% higher if no screening was. </seg>
<seg id="61"> That is why I recommend the test at the age of 50 or 40 years ago, if you have a direct relatives, who was already ill with prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> In men of American origin, there is also a higher risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The most important thing is to make the right decision, as soon as a cancer was identified. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There are cancers that aggressive and others who are indolent. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Really understand the magnitude of the risk of cancer the patients must be made by him to the possible options, which can remain untreated prostate crabs, if he does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases to prefer an active monitoring of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, many of the men, which is cancer, no treatment, not because their cancer is aggressive and poses no threat to their lives. </seg>
<seg id="67"> It proposes an active monitoring them and offers them in advance of the disease treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> With increasing accuracy determined the criteria for a decision that should be dealt with. </seg>
<seg id="69"> I therefore recommend the implementation of the tests. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But the most important thing is to talk to his doctor to determine whether or not he should be carried out. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In cooperation with the international society for urology Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA tests. </seg>
<seg id="72"> This document (currently only available in English, but a translation will be available soon) can be downloaded at the following address: http: / / ca.movember.com / fr / mens Health / prostate cancer screening </seg>
<seg id="73"> To prevent the disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet for the prevention of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress in the research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of developing it. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all eating well and will be sufficient. </seg>
<seg id="77"> &quot;If there were no smoking, this value would rise at least 50%,&quot; says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society. </seg>
<seg id="78"> However, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancers caused by inheritance. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Several remain unresolved. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the fall in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer. </seg>
<seg id="82"> It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer. </seg>
<seg id="83"> It damages the health of the people. </seg>
<seg id="84"> &quot;Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,&quot; the spokesman André Beaulieu regrets. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, reduces the risk of dying from cancer by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> The weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> According to the Canadian Cancer Society overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="88"> It seems the risk for breast, colon, rectal, esophageal, pancreatic and cervical cancer. </seg>
<seg id="89"> &quot;Research shows that regular physical activity protects against colon cancer throughout the entire life,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="90"> The diet </seg>
<seg id="91"> The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In great quantity it increases the risk of developing a Grimm or rectal cancer. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Salami should be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The conservation of meat by smoking, drying or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens. </seg>
<seg id="95"> &quot;The latter can harm the body cells and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, several scientists have studied the link between vitamin supplements and cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> Currently, but their investigations are not conclusive. </seg>
<seg id="99"> According to the Canadian Cancer Society are the studies on vitamin E contradictory. </seg>
<seg id="100"> A study has found that reducing the risk of prostate cancer, an increase. </seg>
<seg id="101"> The effect of vitamin D to cancer was also has not yet clear. </seg>
<seg id="102"> In addition, Mr Beaulieu, stressed how important it is to talk with his doctor about his concerns and his family history. </seg>
<seg id="103"> &quot;The implementation of a screening test does not lead to cancer.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="104"> The Higgs boson analysed </seg>
<seg id="105"> The announcement of the possible discovery of the Higgs Bos&apos; last summer has caused a stir, and for good reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> It is believed that the boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism that is responsible for the mass of all the objects in the universe. </seg>
<seg id="107"> And it is the last particle whose existence the Standard Model - our best or the least &quot;false&quot; statement of nature and the behavior of matter -, predicted, but not been observed empirically. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But for the physicist, it is not yet completely sure that it really is the Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particles, and that it is similar to the predicted by the Standard Model Higgs boson. </seg>
<seg id="110"> It seems to be confirmed by new data to be presented this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto, but there are no data to be completely secure. </seg>
<seg id="111"> We are assuming that it is indeed the Higgs, since there is apparently only a small risk of getting things wrong, and we look at what is at stake. </seg>
<seg id="112"> In this world there is inevitably a crucial law that that can&apos;t be two objects in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> It is not possible to break this rule - and do not try too hard, because you are hurt. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Because even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that it is also applies to them: the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that two particles can occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same &quot;quantum state,&quot; with a law &quot;state&quot; by and large, of some of its properties. </seg>
<seg id="115"> On this basis, the physicists share the particles into two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In one corner are the good citizens, who are known as Fermi one and obey polite the Pauli principles. </seg>
<seg id="117"> And in the other the bosons, a nasty bunch of anarchists, which is nothing sacred not in any case, the precautionary principle, which means that they can find themselves in the same time, at the same place. </seg>
<seg id="118"> These bosons divided according to the website the Particle Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (which is absolutely amazing) into two groups: the Greek barys, which we will deal with here and the &quot;power particles,&quot; through which the great forces of nature and with which the Higgs boson, would be used. </seg>
<seg id="119"> It must be stressed, however, that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures, as you might think. </seg>
<seg id="120"> If you are able to read this story, then only thanks to a Bosons exceptional banality: the photon, or particle of the &quot;light&quot; that the &quot;messenger&quot; is of electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> If a particle with an electric charge or change the direction of the electromagnetic field on this &quot;disrupted,&quot; as a pebble, which was thrown into a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> This &quot;disorder&quot; creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and therefore one of the bosons &quot;sources of power.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="123"> More stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same goes for the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, &quot;disrupted,&quot; so that shows the boson. </seg>
<seg id="125"> However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen has to achieve very high energies, a bit like having a frozen pond, whose surface could be spall only by a very large rocks. </seg>
<seg id="126"> That is why a giant particle accelerator as CERN, the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with an of 27 km! - In order to achieve this kind of energy. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with the electromagnetic field is helpful in the relationship between the Higgs and the crowd. </seg>
<seg id="128"> It is not in fact all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, like magnets, do this, but not others - for example, would never keep a piece of paper from the fridge. </seg>
<seg id="130"> And not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the other (like the photon) have no mass. </seg>
<seg id="131"> For all this research, &quot;which can be good,&quot; says Mrs Plamondon? </seg>
<seg id="132"> For the science they serve the review of the Standard Model (SM), and they also allow the physicists, all deviations between the observations and to investigate the predictions of the SM. </seg>
<seg id="133"> There are also many physicists who sincerely hope that such discrepancies are found, because the slightest difference open a door to a &quot;new physics&quot; and could fill a few holes of the model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> It must be said that there are still major shortcomings in the latter, because there is no explanation for the gravity (ups!), and the dark matter, which is about 80% of matter in the universe (again ups!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> But at the CERN such deviations were not found until now. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Impact </seg>
<seg id="137"> The implications of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be no. </seg>
<seg id="138"> By the way: in the early 60 s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell labs have that their work would trigger such a revolution. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They saw scientific applications, but nothing else. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - has worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser in the 1960 s was invented 1962, and even the first laser (the first was NI) has developed - said that the laser at the beginning rather than a &quot;gimmick.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="141"> Imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> In addition, there are also applications for all the instruments that surround the research. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, in turn, has developed warm Willard Boyle 1969 during his work in the pulp a small light sensor. </seg>
<seg id="144"> Although it was not the original purpose of this sensor today all digital cameras worldwide as &quot;eye&quot; and has won him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="145"> Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC inevitably will change our lives, but it means that you can never really know... </seg>
<seg id="146"> Palliative care - the best way to die... </seg>
<seg id="147"> With its Committee on &quot;death with dignity&quot; Quebec recently discussed the sensitive issue of life. </seg>
<seg id="148"> The debate must be resumed shortly, although a bill is being prepared. </seg>
<seg id="149"> However, there remains to be done in this important area. </seg>
<seg id="150"> Financing academic has tried to look as this. </seg>
<seg id="151"> A few weeks ago Mr L. still lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie. </seg>
<seg id="152"> The prostate cancer, it aufzehrte, had left him a period of two years. </seg>
<seg id="153"> &quot;They gave me to live five years, I have managed seven years,&quot; he said half-heartedly, in his bed at home for palliative care Victor Gadbois in Belo pursuit, in which he arrived the previous the day. </seg>
<seg id="154"> &quot;It is always a shock, however, it is not to be prepared,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="155"> The disease is doing its work: a huge weakness prevents him from going to the toilet and even to eat. </seg>
<seg id="156"> On the table before a delicious lunch, he resigned, agrees to help. </seg>
<seg id="157"> He even manages to smile bravely and speak with strangers who are around him, give him his medication, and offer him a bath. </seg>
<seg id="158"> The courage of ordinary people. </seg>
<seg id="159"> &quot;My greatest wish is that my cures diarrhea, as this is humiliating,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="160"> A few hours later, the team has found a cure for this disease. </seg>
<seg id="161"> &quot;During our lifetime we learn that loves a man standing,&quot; says Pierre Brod, psychologist Victor Gadbois at home. </seg>
<seg id="162"> In return, the childhood phase for some people is an unacceptable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="163"> &quot;It depends on the ability of the person&quot; to accept a retrograde step, he says. </seg>
<seg id="164"> Because, according to several people who work in the palliative care, big events in the midst of setbacks. </seg>
<seg id="165"> The patients who are admitted into the home for palliative care Victor Gadbois, all suffering from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="166"> They have a maximum life expectancy of three months. </seg>
<seg id="167"> At this stage, be they from the doctors and nurses who care for them, not inundated with so-called &quot;healing&quot; care. </seg>
<seg id="168"> For Mrs A., 89, is the worst fear, &quot;and&quot; to die by suffocation. </seg>
<seg id="169"> But the disease I learned my children really know. </seg>
<seg id="170"> &quot;I have good children,&quot; she adds. </seg>
<seg id="171"> &quot;I have no wishes to be in life,&quot; she says, before accepting that it set up a mask that helps her breathe. </seg>
<seg id="172"> They expected in the next few days, a recent visit by her son, who is from Italy. </seg>
<seg id="173"> Based on Victor Gadbois provides you with a group of volunteers personal care and assistance in the food. </seg>
<seg id="174"> The palliative care is used if there are no other options. </seg>
<seg id="175"> In order to make the deaths. </seg>
<seg id="176"> In Quebec, with 11,700 inhabitants a bed for the palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="177"> This is very little, given that we will all die one day. </seg>
<seg id="178"> It is simply a continuation of the life in the best possible conditions, said Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Both at the level of the physical, emotional or spiritual comfort. </seg>
<seg id="180"> It provides for the dying, according to a with brandy or Pepsi. </seg>
<seg id="181"> The diabetics need to control blood sugar levels. </seg>
<seg id="182"> And the death is part of everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="183"> Yesterday evening, we served a beer Mr X, who died during the night. </seg>
<seg id="184"> This morning, his son will drink the beer at the foot of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="185"> &quot;We help families and patients alike,&quot; says nursing director Nathalie Savard. </seg>
<seg id="186"> Based on Victor Gadbois is different every day. </seg>
<seg id="187"> In addition to an old man of 93 years, the last family gathering in the courtyard and is supported well by his pillow, while opening up to his honor, a young man of 36 years dies, which is surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, tragically, having tried everything in order to survive. </seg>
<seg id="188"> &quot;For six months are three to five beds with cancer patients aged less than 45 years,&quot; says Dr. Christiane Martel worries. </seg>
<seg id="189"> 53% of the pet Victor Gadbois hospitalised patients come from their home, 47% come from the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="190"> Problem of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="191"> It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, that is, to a care, which is to alleviate the suffering of patients, when they have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in a hospital or a nursing home. </seg>
<seg id="192"> And several organisations, such as the pet Victor Gadbois and society for domestic palliative care in the Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients. </seg>
<seg id="193"> It is this major shortcomings in the health care of Quebec ensures that several in the palliative care specialist doctors look forward to the adoption of of a law on euthanasia and assistiertem suicide with concerns. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Since the month of October is a manifesto, signed by prominent figures in the palliative care as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to express their opposition to such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id="195"> According to Dr. Christiane Martel Quebec the health system is not powerful enough to ensure that everyone has the right to a high-quality palliative care before accepting move to euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="196"> Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency room, has taken measures to alleviate. </seg>
<seg id="197"> I fear that patients want to die simply because they do not receive adequate health care. </seg>
<seg id="198"> The, while several oncologists treat their patients despite worst predictions fought until the last day. </seg>
<seg id="199"> The survival of Hélène Richard were minimal, as it has broken off a difficult chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="200"> As I told my oncologist that I will drop out of the treatment, she said to me that they regret that I am giving up the fight, told. </seg>
<seg id="201"> However, she said to me that I was at the end. </seg>
<seg id="202"> No omnipotent care </seg>
<seg id="203"> Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die, thank the nursing staff that it has not granted this wish, after their pain has been eased by a team of palliative care. </seg>
<seg id="204"> But it must be said clearly that is not the Continuum palliative care for pain treatment. </seg>
<seg id="205"> After a young man Monereau, director of the palliative care of society is not talking of domestic palliative care of Greater Montreal 8% of patients in pain treatment. </seg>
<seg id="206"> At the very end of life so doctors often back to the C-terminal sedation, which seeks to lull the patients either permanently or intermittently until the time of his death. </seg>
<seg id="207"> We can no longer act as if we do not see this side of the suffering. </seg>
<seg id="208"> Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to use this C-terminal sedation. </seg>
<seg id="209"> Patients, not to alleviate their pain, all say the same sentence: &quot;I want to die.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="210"> But that does not necessarily mean, &quot;I want to put me,&quot; but &quot;I would like to see reduced my pain.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="211"> The implementation of this report was possible on the basis of a journalism scholarship Canadian health research institutes. </seg>
<seg id="212"> Real estate major scandals in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="213"> Officials of the roads, companies in the building industry sector, political parties and fundraisers specialists of the Italian mafia tell every day what they know about a great &quot;system,&quot; in the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso. </seg>
<seg id="214"> An &quot;industry,&quot; which was very expensive for the taxpayer of Quebec, especially in the 1990 s and 2000 s. </seg>
<seg id="215"> &quot;It is strange how the system, since it has taken drastic measures,&quot; Sperling jokes Jacques Duchesneau, Member of Montreal in Quebec and a former head of the police. </seg>
<seg id="216"> The scandal was exposed by him on the basis of a thorough investigation into the embezzlement in connection with the treaties to road construction in Quebec, who agreed to the then prime minister reluctantly. </seg>
<seg id="217"> The &quot;Duchesneau report&quot; established a direct link between industry, secret funding of political parties and bribery of officials. </seg>
<seg id="218"> &quot;Since the beginning of the study in 2010,&quot; he said, &quot;the transport ministry alone would have saved a billion dollars of the Treaties,&quot; because some zügelten its instinct to get their share. </seg>
<seg id="219"> The Charbonneau Commission &quot;has already brought two mayors on a case-by-case basis,&quot; he adds, in the hope that it can &quot;to show the tactics behind the individuals.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="220"> Launched in 2011, permanent anti-corruption unit </seg>
<seg id="221"> Launched in 2011, permanent anti-corruption unit is with its troops to auditors, investigating and analysts of the government. </seg>
<seg id="222"> In addition, the police force, &quot;and was,&quot; which since 2009 has ensured that the &quot;sewer cartel&quot; Montreal is in the artificial inflation of of the Treaties cautious... </seg>
<seg id="223"> In recent weeks it has made a series of raids and made allegations of fraud and corruption against local officeholders, such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marc Otte, the mayor of a suburb. </seg>
<seg id="224"> The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec&apos;s third largest city, has resigned. </seg>
<seg id="225"> He is suspected of repeatedly received in exchange for public contracts bribes. </seg>
<seg id="226"> Incidentally, engineers were specifically accused of road construction official from Montreal, and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito. </seg>
<seg id="227"> The latter has attracted attention by the Commission of the operation of the &quot;system&quot; has declared for the preservation of public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="228"> He himself has paid for several years in Montreal received 3% of the value of the contracts to a broker linked to the Mafia, who gave the money to the Union, the party of mayors Geraldine Tremblay. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Mr Zambito everywhere in the 2000 s has had his hand in the game by more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals in power at the time. </seg>
<seg id="230"> He also confessed to organising an illegal fund-raising for the former liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normand Jauneau. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Sewerage contracts, the costs of have been artificially inflated </seg>
<seg id="232"> In Montreal, the &quot;system&quot; of corruption. </seg>
<seg id="233"> The former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant has described in detail the Commission: in ten years ago, he received from the construction company gifts and invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes amounting to $736,000 in exchange for sewerage contracts, whose cost it artificially pumping up. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Other Road Administration officials have admitted that they did, by aufblähten smear the bills with false services artificially by 30-40%. </seg>
<seg id="235"> In addition, an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay, that he has deliberately overlooked a shadow budget, filled its coffers with undeclared money. </seg>
<seg id="236"> As a result of these revelations Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, which left Montreal in a serious crisis. </seg>
<seg id="237"> Chantal Rouleau, was one of the first Members of Montreal, proposed the alarm. </seg>
<seg id="238"> As mayor of the District Rivière of Prai Ries, in the east of the island, they declined from 2010 against the sale of municipal land that bought for $5 million and was sold for 1.6 million of property developers in the booming real estate market. </seg>
<seg id="239"> 70% black money in election campaigns </seg>
<seg id="240"> The study, conducted at the end of the, she says that it &quot;takes on a thread, which it to understand the operation of the suspected of ants system to stop this evil and denounce those responsible.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="241"> She says that the process &quot;painful, but positive.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="242"> We are about to clean the wound, but need a certain investigative unit, only for Montreal and supervision to prevent a return of the questionable practices. </seg>
<seg id="243"> How do you clean. </seg>
<seg id="244"> Regularly. </seg>
<seg id="245"> For its part, Jacques Duchesneau notes that &quot;officials have stolen several hundred million dollars,&quot; but especially concerned about the role of &quot;office holders, who are the tactics in the picture,&quot; if they were not involved in the fraud. </seg>
<seg id="246"> Based on a 70% share of black money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: &quot;I was told that this is a poor substitute for reality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="247"> The government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to parties at $100, according to what he would change nothing about the situation: &quot;as long as the election campaign spending will be strictly limited, black money in politics.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="248"> He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for awarding public contracts and financing of the parties: &quot;we must not go deeper; when we get to the bottom with courage, we can can build a house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="249"> If this story is damaging the international image of Quebec in Montreal, calls Mr Duchesneau those who laugh about it, to look in their own backyard... </seg>
<seg id="250"> &quot;PSG is not the FC Barcelona!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="251"> This season with PSG have adopted a new scale. </seg>
<seg id="252"> How do you explain this progress? </seg>
<seg id="253"> You can explain it with a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG. </seg>
<seg id="254"> Great players have come. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Every day I am on their side. </seg>
<seg id="256"> The technical staff has given me a lot. </seg>
<seg id="257"> These factors spurring me on a daily basis to improve my game. </seg>
<seg id="258"> And in a game that is even easier. </seg>
<seg id="259"> In football everything is going very quickly. </seg>
<seg id="260"> But I must stop in enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id="261"> Since my early days at the centre of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine up to my time in St Etienne I have always made gradual progress. </seg>
<seg id="262"> They take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti... </seg>
<seg id="263"> This summer the newcomers are used to host games very high levels. </seg>
<seg id="264"> They also know that every training session. </seg>
<seg id="265"> This means that a player like me, and wants to give his best. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Incidentally, it gives me a lot in terms of my game Carlo.Its Ancelotti. </seg>
<seg id="267"> It is supported by other coaches as Claude blemish, who played in the same position as me. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Ancelotti is the right person for the job? </seg>
<seg id="269"> Of course. </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ancelotti breathes all technicians respect. </seg>
<seg id="271"> In the Ligue 1, there are currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="272"> He has a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs. </seg>
<seg id="273"> He had contact with great players. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I think that he will win another title in Paris. </seg>
<seg id="275"> In January, I had a good conversation with him. </seg>
<seg id="276"> At the time, I had just recovered from a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="277"> The trust that he has put in me, is also an explanation for my services. </seg>
<seg id="278"> What do you think about the first part of the season of PSG? </seg>
<seg id="279"> In the Ligue 1 Lyon has taken the place of the top. </seg>
<seg id="280"> But we are in the ambush. </seg>
<seg id="281"> One of our main objectives is the Champions League: we have qualified in this way for the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="282"> What is the objective of the club in this competition? </seg>
<seg id="283"> We will try to get as much as possible. </seg>
<seg id="284"> From now on, everything is possible. </seg>
<seg id="285"> However, we will have our say against very good European teams. </seg>
<seg id="286"> First, we want to be the first of our group in Porto, so that we can deal with the return leg of the eighth and final home game. </seg>
<seg id="287"> The PSG can be a big European club in the short term? </seg>
<seg id="288"> He already has the budget... </seg>
<seg id="289"> In order to become a major European club, to win Paris title and make a name for the long term. </seg>
<seg id="290"> This is not the case today. </seg>
<seg id="291"> The PSG financial resources, so that this project is the concrete forms. </seg>
<seg id="292"> It would be a great failure to win the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case last season? </seg>
<seg id="293"> Of course, this would be a great disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="294"> This year, it is really important for us to cream off the title. </seg>
<seg id="295"> In the last season we were close. </seg>
<seg id="296"> In May, we were disappointed, because we were strong enough to secure the victory. </seg>
<seg id="297"> We have finished the season with a very strong performance. </seg>
<seg id="298"> We have finished with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="299"> You should normally be champion with 79 points... </seg>
<seg id="300"> But another team, those of Montpellier, has made an even better season. </seg>
<seg id="301"> I believe that this is the right one. </seg>
<seg id="302"> Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux fight for the title, I believe that we have what it takes to win. </seg>
<seg id="303"> Do you think that the media expect too much from the PSG? </seg>
<seg id="304"> In view of what has been done and the players that we have, it is natural that much is expected of us. </seg>
<seg id="305"> We fully accept that. </seg>
<seg id="306"> If we win with a home game against Troyes 4-0, and it is still something that cannot be accused, this is a bit frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="307"> One wonders what people expect. </seg>
<seg id="308"> We could never win every weekend with 4-0. </seg>
<seg id="309"> We are not the FC Barcelona! </seg>
<seg id="310"> We are trying to draw up a game plan. </seg>
<seg id="311"> A team builds over time. </seg>
<seg id="312"> In the Champions League we have shown strength. </seg>
<seg id="313"> You look at Manchester City, a club for two seasons, to qualify for the eighth final, and also has made huge spending. </seg>
<seg id="314"> With regard to the amounts invested you believed to break with 15 points ahead of the. </seg>
<seg id="315"> This would mean that would let our opponents and the French Cup. </seg>
<seg id="316"> Lyon and Marseille, who were not in the last season, this new PSG &quot;geboostet.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="317"> This shows that the Ligue 1 exciting. </seg>
<seg id="318"> I hope that we will be in the month of May by the smiling winner and tell us that we have won despite all the difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="319"> The PSG seems to be entirely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. </seg>
<seg id="320"> So much the better, that of a &quot;Zlatan dependence.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="321"> This means that Ibrahimovic is performing well and scores many goals. </seg>
<seg id="322"> That is why he came and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1. </seg>
<seg id="323"> Wherever he has played, he has had in mind that he is a great player and a world star. </seg>
<seg id="324"> Within the team, we respect both the player and the person. </seg>
<seg id="325"> He also respects the people who surrounded him. </seg>
<seg id="326"> What he has done is exceptional. </seg>
<seg id="327"> This encourages others to improve their game. </seg>
<seg id="328"> Taina Silva, who is one of the best defenders, allowing the rest to make progress. </seg>
<seg id="329"> As you have seen the Euro 2012 with the French national team? </seg>
<seg id="330"> As a disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I was anxious to take part in this championships. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me from glean some game time. </seg>
<seg id="333"> I have seen things, which I am emerged strengthened. </seg>
<seg id="334"> Today, I will be able to make good games in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="335"> This was my hope for my baptism with the &quot;Bleus.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="336"> From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we must show an exemplary behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="337"> What are your views on the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the &quot;Bleus&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="338"> He has achieved promising results. </seg>
<seg id="339"> We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="340"> The national trainer is strictly, the players and encourages the to victory. </seg>
<seg id="341"> As it was Laurent Blanc. </seg>
<seg id="342"> But I would like to make a comparison. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Blanc had achieved its goal, he had qualified for the European Championships. </seg>
<seg id="344"> I hope that Didier Deschamps &quot;Bleus&quot; will lead to Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Is that on 16 October in Spain forced draw (1:1) an opening the game? </seg>
<seg id="346"> This game has given us confidence. </seg>
<seg id="347"> Everyone has campaigned for everyone else. </seg>
<seg id="348"> Before the meeting in Spain, I have never seen a similar game in my career. </seg>
<seg id="349"> With Bitcoin is and selling without bank possible </seg>
<seg id="350"> The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, unidentified transactions and administrative fees between the parties. </seg>
<seg id="351"> Moreover, as so often happens in these technologies is a political vision: the belief that the current bank monopolies designed monetary system, leading to financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="352"> In fact, is that Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) invented Bitcoin both a virtual currency (but in dollar, euro convertible, etc.) as well as a protocol for the secure exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files. </seg>
<seg id="353"> With 15,000 computers in the network has already covered some 200,000 transactions. </seg>
<seg id="354"> Several thousand websites Bitcoin accept a donation or payment. </seg>
<seg id="355"> After the course of Bitcoin in June 2011 a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) had reached five months later, he fell to 2 dollars, before he has now recovered to around ten dollars (the courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com). </seg>
<seg id="356"> Nothing particularly low prices compared to the world trade currencies or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="357"> However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has in a report published in October on virtual currencies interest. </seg>
<seg id="358"> Bitcoin describes as &quot;the virtual currency with the greatest success,&quot; &quot;in competition with the dollar or euro&quot; and &quot;similar to the conventional currencies.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="359"> Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the &quot;credits&quot; that will be used to move forward in a video game, win or kupić through games (and sometimes) can. </seg>
<seg id="360"> The social networking site Facebook has developed such a system. </seg>
<seg id="361"> However, the trade is controlled and processed each time by a central authority. </seg>
<seg id="362"> With Bitcoin all network node of the accounting book depository, auditors at the same time, money, issuers and buyers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="363"> How does this network? </seg>
<seg id="364"> Every transaction between two users will take place in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="365"> With the difference that the user can choose for each payment to a different address, ensuring the anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="366"> A number of data relating to this transaction will be signed electronically by a double encryption system. </seg>
<seg id="367"> In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="368"> With the help of the content of the file it is also possible to ensure that the Bitcoins traded in the accounting book of the entire network of public accounts. </seg>
<seg id="369"> The crucial step is to sign this new transaction in this book. </seg>
<seg id="370"> This is a mathematical task, which will be run on computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, has the privilege to add these additional line. </seg>
<seg id="371"> It is a carving up the file, the conversion of a large file in a shorter and unambiguous electronic fingerprint. </seg>
<seg id="372"> The computer ,&quot;&quot; the new transaction and add a number, before the whole thing &quot;a.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="373"> The aim is to find the one number that a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="374"> If this number has been found that can examine the other nodes, whether it is the right one. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The transaction is continuously linked with the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint. </seg>
<seg id="376"> If an user to pay for cheating twice very fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money would only be validated by the network and the other remains one of the two transactions without linkage, since both have different fingerprints. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The computer has solved the task gets 50 Bitcoins. </seg>
<seg id="378"> To prevent inflation will be halved this reward regularly, probably before the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The Bitcoins in circulation are limited to 21 million, but up to a hundred millionth divisible, leaving a margin... </seg>
<seg id="380"> It also increases the difficulty of the task with any improvement in computing power. </seg>
<seg id="381"> The life of the network has had ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="382"> The websites that provide services for Bitcoin, were attacked and stolen the Bitcoin deposits. </seg>
<seg id="383"> &quot;The weakness is not the actual protocol,&quot; Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, a company to pay real money and uses the network Bitcoin. </seg>
<seg id="384"> The ECB also reported on the possibility of money laundering by means of this anonymous service. </seg>
<seg id="385"> But also cash these shortcomings. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Important players like Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="387"> Others, such as the blog platform WordPress, they will be accepted. </seg>
<seg id="388"> Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, the accounting book shows and that almost 80% of the Bitcoins in circulation. </seg>
<seg id="389"> A &quot;mega sale&quot; was launched in November. </seg>
<seg id="390"> &quot;Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged,&quot; Jon Holmquist, who works for the company&apos;s Bitcoins Coin Abul, converted into gold. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Pierre Noizat, who is also author of a book about the currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network. </seg>
<seg id="392"> His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but Bitcoin validation of the transactions, which are cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="393"> In addition, the owner&apos;s identity and therefore can remain anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="394"> The system can easily be implemented with the, and they do not need to install new terminals or computer programs. </seg>
<seg id="395"> They simply need to an address, photographed and identified by a telephone &quot;can be,&quot; Pierre Noizat, who assured us that he has thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="396"> There is a general trend to be reconsidered in the hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontally oriented systems. </seg>
<seg id="397"> &quot;It will take some time to prevail Bitcoin, but 2013 could be a turning point,&quot; he predicted. </seg>
<seg id="398"> The ECB sees in her report, the, the different, highly regarded today than to assess risks in the event of a success of this currency. </seg>
<seg id="399"> We are withdrawing from Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="400"> And then? </seg>
<seg id="401"> French troops have their responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi). </seg>
<seg id="402"> NATO and the United States are likely to be at the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="403"> It is time for the Afghan army to take possession of their territory, and that the Afghan people to decide their own future, without expecting anything from us. </seg>
<seg id="404"> We have to be punished, the Afghan farmers as, they are considered terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="405"> And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed and the injured and crippled. </seg>
<seg id="406"> The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also from farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence, such as at the time of the Soviets. </seg>
<seg id="407"> They want to defend their old and archaic traditions, even if they are jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks. </seg>
<seg id="408"> The latter will not be tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, as if the Western countries are discreet. </seg>
<seg id="409"> The withdrawal of French troops from the base in Nijrab, I have observed with almond trees hills, was financed with the help of French loans, was carried out properly. </seg>
<seg id="410"> The countryside below helicopters, trucks and armored convoys have reached Kabul, without being attacked. </seg>
<seg id="411"> From the end of 2014 there will be no more preparation of the Taliban in Kabul. </seg>
<seg id="412"> The conditions have changed since her irresistible rise from 1994 to 1996. </seg>
<seg id="413"> Overrun Kabul was empty and the country due to the struggles of the various insurgent groups from the war. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Their power was seen as a kind of liberation and return to safety. </seg>
<seg id="415"> Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the Al Qaeda organisation overpowered farmers, but their situation has not improved. </seg>
<seg id="416"> Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and Taliban have a common desire to keep the women in a subordinate position. </seg>
<seg id="417"> The main leaders of the anti-Soviet war came to power in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="418"> They have turned into this racket property seized by the government, in order to sell them as a land of refugees from Iran and Pakistan and to benefit from the massive American subcontracting. </seg>
<seg id="419"> They have brought into disrepute, and most of them were not involved in the fighting. </seg>
<seg id="420"> As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves. </seg>
<seg id="421"> Many young people want to leave the country, as those who were able to take advantage of the American contributions: the capital flight is considerable. </seg>
<seg id="422"> The young people have of the war and its ideology. </seg>
<seg id="423"> During their exile in Iran and Pakistan have had contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed the benefits. </seg>
<seg id="424"> About 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population. </seg>
<seg id="425"> The state schools in the cities are full of boys and girls. </seg>
<seg id="426"> These young people who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the parties to the corruption of certain executives, will have to make jobs available. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Everyone, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones, television with his Turkish series, which is a modern world, everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="428"> An army is now available. </seg>
<seg id="429"> The authorities, under whose command they will be seen as legitimate? </seg>
<seg id="430"> Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle already are trying to restore the militias in the province, which are beyond the power of the central government. </seg>
<seg id="431"> Afghanistan, the land of the mountains with strong local identities should benefit from a degree of decentralisation in the Western nations, but the abolition of the office of the prime minister, which dated back to the constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make it a centralised state with a strong Präsidialgewalt. </seg>
<seg id="432"> President Karzai does not want foreign inspections, especially during the elections planned for April 2014. </seg>
<seg id="433"> However, his country since the 50 s and long before dependent on foreign aid. </seg>
<seg id="434"> Industries have been Ailles functional storage facilities are not available and major irrigation system had been repaired. </seg>
<seg id="435"> Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables produced nothing. </seg>
<seg id="436"> The private initiative is the priority. </seg>
<seg id="437"> In a country that has been directed by 30 years of war, would have been a state control of infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="438"> The rumor was spread that Afghanistan had huge natural resources. </seg>
<seg id="439"> This reinforces the impression that Western countries were only there to seize it. </seg>
<seg id="440"> Without energy, to process iron or copper ore on the spot, and without any means of transport for export over the mountains is not a mining. </seg>
<seg id="441"> The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) make their excavations at the vast Buddhist site and remain the major employers in the province. </seg>
<seg id="442"> One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, restore normal relations. </seg>
<seg id="443"> The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on 20 November. </seg>
<seg id="444"> The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls and boys, Institute for French high schools of the universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support the archaeological delegation. </seg>
<seg id="445"> Since 2009, has a service &quot;civilian-military actions&quot; of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was closed in 2012, carried out in dozens of mountain villages numerous charitable work and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture and carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation in order to try to win the &quot;hearts and minds&quot; and the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions. </seg>
<seg id="446"> This work, for the many local workers were required to have can help to suppress the uprising:, irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase of agricultural land. </seg>
<seg id="447"> What we leave military spending of two billion euros? </seg>
<seg id="448"> A much more modest budget will help to improve the local living conditions that are often at a height of more than 2000 meters nearby valleys in these very hard. </seg>
<seg id="449"> In the message made dozens of written questions small agricultural projects of municipalities of the province Kapisa. </seg>

<seg id="451"> A constitution with a crowbar in Egypt </seg>
<seg id="452"> It is a new poker game of President Mohammed Morsi. </seg>
<seg id="453"> While Egypt in relation to the constitutional declaration, which gives him unlimited power temporarily, more divided than ever, he has decided to put all our eggs in one basket. </seg>
<seg id="454"> To the surprise of all, he has announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly will adopt the next day his final version. </seg>
<seg id="455"> The head of state had granted just a week ago this House two additional months to complete its work. </seg>
<seg id="456"> For almost two years now Egypt is based on a preliminary, repeatedly amended text, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal mess. </seg>
<seg id="457"> This new initiative has only for even greater division of the country. </seg>
<seg id="458"> For his opponents of the president in his &quot;autocratic delirium,&quot; he continues to &quot;breaking his word&quot; and &quot;the right underfoot.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="459"> On the side of his supporters are assured that there is a way, the institutional and political crisis to an end as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process. </seg>
<seg id="460"> A referendum should be held within 14 days. </seg>
<seg id="461"> A very short period of, forcing the brothers to abandon their plans to explain the Egyptians the text section for section. </seg>
<seg id="462"> It is also a way for the president, to his public and democratic legitimacy, while protests raging across the country. </seg>
<seg id="463"> As you have heard in an interview with the American Wochenschau Time Mohamed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Given that the Egyptian people will be charged with this recourse to a hasty vote an ultimatum: &quot;Either agrees for my draft or I am the unlimited power,&quot; the latter should take after the adoption of the Constitution to an end. </seg>
<seg id="465"> 85 mostly Islamist members of the constituent assembly approved the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere. </seg>

<seg id="718"> According to Dmitri Kislow by the organisation &quot;Pravo na oryzhie&quot; you can buy a gun type Makarov for $100 to 300 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="719"> You have to wait up to a year and a half months. </seg>
<seg id="720"> The weapon is spent in military weapons camps of middle-ranking supervisors. </seg>
<seg id="721"> According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of crimes involving illegal weapons across Russia in the period from January to October 2011, at 7% to 22.9 thousand, while the number of detected cases of theft and extortion in connection with weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices shrank by 7.8%. </seg>
<seg id="722"> In the U.S. strike fast food and supermarket workers </seg>
<seg id="723"> One in four American teenagers sitting somewhere behind the cash register at McDonald&apos;s </seg>
<seg id="724"> In recent days there have been all over the United States to massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants popular fast food chains like McDonald&apos;s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy&apos;s and Kentucky Fried Chicken. </seg>
<seg id="725"> Yet no one can predict whether the protests will even further or whether they are out of the air again soon. </seg>
<seg id="726"> The protests are supported by unions and several leftist non-governmental organisations. </seg>
<seg id="727"> In addition to the increase in the modest wages of ordinary Walmart and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests aim to set up trade unions. </seg>
<seg id="728"> So far, this sector of the economy are not unionized. </seg>
<seg id="729"> 46 cents per year? </seg>
<seg id="730"> The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on so-called Black Friday, which took place in the United States sales turn the millions of customers, which sometimes led to hand mixtures. </seg>
<seg id="731"> On this day, some Walmart employees, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, its work and Carnegie together with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain, which targets individuals with low and middle income. </seg>
<seg id="732"> Walm kind sold all products, nappies on hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="733"> The commodity in the Walmart stores, on average, between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="734"> That is why many of the paid Walmart employees buy only at the workplace. </seg>
<seg id="735"> The prices and the assortment of goods made Walmart, one of the largest companies in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="736"> Critics say Walmart can sell the goods often so cheaply because the employees are paid poorly. </seg>
<seg id="737"> The latter also complain of difficult working conditions, such as lack of forklift trucks or hand scanners. </seg>
<seg id="738"> The participants in the protests on &quot;Black Friday&quot; demanded wage increases and expressed their anger about the fact that the contribution to the company health insurance from 30 to 100 dollars a month. </seg>
<seg id="739"> A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 a hour, could afford this increase, they said. </seg>
<seg id="740"> Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley, that if the company increased the average wage to 12 dollars a hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="741"> There are about 1.1% more than they pay now. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Would pass on Walmart wage increases to the customers, every purchase they cost only 46 cents more in the future. </seg>
<seg id="743"> They compared to today, which would be a year for additional expenditure of only 12.39 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="744"> Advocates of Walmart note with satisfaction that it only in nine states to protests, and brought them to the company any losses. </seg>
<seg id="745"> The Black Friday took in his shop on Thursday from 8 p.m. until midnight the next day, and during that period, Walmart sold about 5000 items per second. </seg>
<seg id="746"> Overall, the Walmart cashier on &quot;Black Friday&quot; almost 100 million transactions. </seg>
<seg id="747"> The company&apos;s spokesman, Dan Fogel, who claimed in an interview on the website of the left-leaning Huffington post that &quot;less than five&quot; Walmart employees work, and the protest action is yet another &quot;PR stunt,&quot; of the trade union, which organised the protests, and. </seg>
<seg id="748"> &quot;Free money!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="749"> The protests erupted this week in New York, where Walmart stores (which are not not in this progressive city, and so far non-existent), but McDonald&apos;s and other cheap restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="750"> McDonald&apos;s says that the companies sell billions of chickens, and yet you are granted no sick days, and you will not pay for your honest work. </seg>
<seg id="751"> Juma said Williams, a member of the New York City Council </seg>
<seg id="752"> Currently, the minimum wage legislation under federal and New York at $7.25 a hour. </seg>
<seg id="753"> In fast food restaurants will gradually raise the minimum wage, but not too much, and on average get their simple employees in New York $8.90 a hour. </seg>
<seg id="754"> No one less than it deserves in this expensive city. </seg>
<seg id="755"> As it is possible to live in New York with so little money, is beyond me. </seg>
<seg id="756"> There was a time in which almost a quarter of all American young people after school at McDonald&apos;s stood behind the counter, but the young people were living with their parents. </seg>
<seg id="757"> Hardly anyone saw it is the main source of income or to stay there. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Now meet me in interviews with employees of McDonald&apos;s always people who complain that they have with this wage and sometimes even to feed their children. </seg>
<seg id="759"> On the other hand, there is a comment in the forum of the newspaper the Wall Street Journal, the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children, if you don&apos;t know how it is to feed. </seg>
<seg id="760"> Participants in the protests, which on Thursday at 6,30 a.m. in front of the McDonald&apos;s began in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks of fast-food restaurants a minimum wage of $15 a hour, which is more than a doubling of the the current minimum wage. </seg>
<seg id="761"> They also called for the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry. </seg>
<seg id="762"> The U.S. law prevents the management to stand in the way of this objective and union members to admonish or to dismiss. </seg>
<seg id="763"> On the other hand, does not make the management of them. </seg>
<seg id="764"> The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry is, but also for objective reasons. </seg>
<seg id="765"> The main reason is the high staff turnover. </seg>
<seg id="766"> Unhappy </seg>
<seg id="767"> On this day, there were strident protests from many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="768"> The high point of the protests was a meeting at noon in front of the McDonald&apos;s in Times Square, where some local Democrats, including City Council member Juma said Williams, who said: &quot;McDonald&apos;s said that it sell billions portions, and yet they&apos;ll be given no sick days, and you will not pay for your honest work.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="769"> The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, Mayor Bill De Blasio candidate who said that &quot;we should work together supporting the fast-food workers, so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve economic prosperity, deserves every New Yorker!.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="770"> According to the New York Times, this was the largest operation of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry. </seg>
<seg id="771"> But there were only a few hundred people on the ground, far from all of them are employed in the fast-food industry, in the working in New York tens of thousands of. </seg>
<seg id="772"> It is not yet clear whether the spark will mobilise whole mass protests. </seg>
<seg id="773"> &quot;The brain is so far the only moderately&quot; </seg>
<seg id="774"> The supporters of modern technologies purveyors of the enlarged reality is perceived in recent times, usually through the lens of a special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="775"> Google first presented at its annual conference in the summer a working model in November, was then announced that Microsoft had also filed a patent. </seg>
<seg id="776"> In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3 D technologies in Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shah Ram Zhila, is clear that the glasses for the scientists of the company&apos;s only a transit station. </seg>
<seg id="777"> The to manipulate virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and to create virtual free. </seg>
<seg id="778"> - Please describe your short, which operates research group. </seg>
<seg id="779"> - We are dealing with the interaction between man and machine, but want to extend the borders of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> So far has remained largely humanity at the, which works with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes affected. </seg>
<seg id="781"> But we want to look ahead 5-10 years, and predicted the radical changes this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="782"> For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors to progress, and today is no longer sold Xbox without, because all interested. </seg>
<seg id="783"> - What awaits us in the future? </seg>
<seg id="784"> - Even the interaction on a physical level, is still much on the flat screen, sometimes in 3 D. </seg>
<seg id="785"> The input of information (the system gets more data) could not be improved, the crucial issue yet. </seg>
<seg id="786"> We are trying to change that, working on real three-dimensional display systems on the basis of various technologies, including projections. </seg>
<seg id="787"> We must dismiss the computer world in our physical world and make it more. </seg>
<seg id="788"> To this end, it is necessary not only to the user, but also its surroundings. </seg>
<seg id="789"> Then we could add to the real world much easier through virtual objects. </seg>
<seg id="790"> And first and foremost, we should be this silly virtual reality helmets! </seg>
<seg id="791"> - What do you think about language? </seg>
<seg id="792"> It is popular, but they are not overvalued? </seg>
<seg id="793"> - It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, because it raises questions about privacy, because they would like to inform all others about his actions and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="794"> In fact, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in their particular niche. </seg>
<seg id="795"> For example, we were working in the field of objects in public places on a project in which we are short and tight, rather than experimenting with sweeping gestures. </seg>
<seg id="796"> These were not the gestures of the object camera, but from recorded by a bracelet that the movements of the bones and muscles registered. </seg>
<seg id="797"> It is still relatively high, but in theory could be reduced to the size of a wristwatch. </seg>
<seg id="798"> But overall, however, such as the future belongs to mixed types of control, for example, gestures and language. </seg>
<seg id="799"> - Like this? </seg>
<seg id="800"> For example, we would ask you to reach out to you that Sprudeldose? </seg>
<seg id="801"> They say it and, at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="802"> Normally, I would say it. </seg>
<seg id="803"> - Oh, that would be very difficult to detect. </seg>
<seg id="804"> - That is, you want the user adjusts to what can&apos;t afford a machine at the time and what? </seg>
<seg id="805"> - Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement. </seg>
<seg id="806"> I think that we in the near future, especially in the development of new types of sensors must be working that make it possible to collect responses from people. </seg>
<seg id="807"> Can be laser sensors, for example, as they offer a good resolution, which is very important. </seg>
<seg id="808"> - What do you make claims based on your work with the Xbox, sensors on modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="809"> There is a lack of resolution, depth or something else? </seg>
<seg id="810"> - The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection. </seg>
<seg id="811"> Of course, not 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps. </seg>
<seg id="812"> But the main thing is not the Megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth. </seg>
<seg id="813"> All current technologies are not good enough for us, the developers of the algorithms more work. </seg>
<seg id="814"> It must be taken into account not only the resolution along the X and Y, but also along the Z axis. </seg>
<seg id="815"> The speed and the number of images per second are important. </seg>
<seg id="816"> The movements of the people are extremely dynamic and open, the current 30 fps in particular for gestures too little. </seg>
<seg id="817"> Stephen Betis, developed in our laboratory in Redmond a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay between 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today&apos;s commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100). </seg>
<seg id="818"> Not all understand how much the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="819"> I needed for my work as a device, only without the control and with more frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="820"> - The number of cameras should not be increased? </seg>
<seg id="821"> -, is currently working with three &quot;cameras,&quot; which is one of them is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a recipient of the reflected signal. </seg>
<seg id="822"> And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera. </seg>
<seg id="823"> It is not used to calculate the object. </seg>
<seg id="824"> More cameras could solve the problem... </seg>
<seg id="825"> Or exacerbate the problem, as more calculations would be necessary. </seg>
<seg id="826"> Nice is a flexible, similar system where we could play with different camera orientation, to see how this helps us in the three-dimensional identifying a position. </seg>
<seg id="827"> - If I remember correctly, not Microsoft, Google, in contrast to his public spectacles. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Do you not think that, with regard to the application of the technology in everyday life the enlarged reality glasses of the best prospects? </seg>
<seg id="829"> - Of course, it is not pleasant always on the to keep a smartphone in your hand, but I think the following: the best option would be a &quot;temporary&quot; enhanced reality in which we could switch on a cloud of the glasses on the smartphone. </seg>
<seg id="830"> The lens is a personal gadget and therein lies its strength (private, you can only see), but also its weakness, because an enlarged reality by means of glasses that you can work together with others in virtual objects. </seg>
<seg id="831"> - Let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air only Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also ordinary mortals. </seg>
<seg id="832"> There is a problem, often point to the critics of this idea: there is no visible reaction. </seg>
<seg id="833"> The hands feel nothing at all. </seg>
<seg id="834"> What answers to give your group at this point? </seg>
<seg id="835"> - In my lectures, I often talk about the enlarged reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="836"> I think the eighth breakthrough might well be the integration of taktilen perception. </seg>
<seg id="837"> An interesting method is the use of second hand as something unusual projection. </seg>
<seg id="838"> It takes pressure perfectly true! </seg>
<seg id="839"> But there are also technologies that are actually designed, in fact, the &quot;pictures in the air&quot; to give something concrete, for example, the interference by some of ultrasound beams at a certain point where the finger, a feeling that is now so weak as someone einherjar over the control. </seg>
<seg id="840"> There are also bands for the wrist on the nerve endings in the fingers, this is also a potential direction. </seg>
<seg id="841"> - Have you tried to outflank the brain? </seg>
<seg id="842"> We think that it can sense what it would feel if it sees something? </seg>
<seg id="843"> - This is a good idea, so we have not tried it yet. </seg>
<seg id="844"> Here is another challenge facing us is that we will have a long time, namely a person who is physically in a closed room, to believe that he is instead in an open, virtually infinite space, where we are working on plans with treadmills (other than in gyms), mobile platforms and large balls. </seg>
<seg id="845"> So far, the brain can outwit only moderately, and we still have many busy years. </seg>
<seg id="846"> That is what makes the work in the field of virtual reality for researchers so attractive: many issues we are at the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="847"> My own taste rather than of culture - rosbalt.ru </seg>
<seg id="848"> Rosbalt project &quot;Petersburg avant-garde&quot; is dedicated to the city dwellers, which form the vanguard of the art and culture. </seg>
<seg id="849"> On the select list already landed high-ranking representatives of the St. Petersburg art scene, whose successes beyond the borders of the city and often find the recognition in Europe, without being in the rest of Russia. </seg>
<seg id="850"> The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artists Kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="851"> The whole town knows Kirill Miller, dressed in red clothed Bärtigen, the at the Russian Museum, sometimes in the summer garden, found at scene meetings or at openings. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Where are the images of Kirill Miller, attract large crowds issued. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg socially philosophical artists, create new myths. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg avant-garde in the late 80 s or early 90 s. </seg>
<seg id="855"> It is also a man of the city and its presence on the street by his fellow citizens a smile in the face and provides them with good humour. </seg>
<seg id="856"> Recently, he grabbed a barrel organ and became the Petersburg hub organ player, because it is a difficult role in his artists, felt his philosophy and his image is finally ready. </seg>
<seg id="857"> - Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow and turquoise in the city? </seg>
<seg id="858"> I have chosen the colour red as a fashion designer who deals with the optics and the image. </seg>
<seg id="859"> In this world is red the compromise between artists, image consultants and society. </seg>
<seg id="860"> In the society calls on everything what differs somewhat from the grey norm, aggression and bad behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="861"> I want to come through my provocations with the people. </seg>
<seg id="862"> Any of my last provocation was an invitation to talk. </seg>
<seg id="863"> - When did you know that you have to be a painter? </seg>
<seg id="864"> - An exhibition in the Palace of Culture News Khoryv, which was my work. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I realised that I have to go down this path. </seg>
<seg id="866"> Then there was the time of the old free, but not officially recognised painter at the time, and new and free painter as I was incomprehensible. </seg>
<seg id="867"> I am friendly with the painters of the new generation, with the representatives of the &quot;Gazonewschina&quot;; it &quot;Pushkinskaya 10,&quot; and it was once. </seg>
<seg id="868"> The theater, fashion, music, in particular, in addition to the literature. </seg>
<seg id="869"> - And all the united in your clinic... It was important to me to be at the heart of Petersburg culture, where should gather the best new artist. </seg>
<seg id="870"> In 1995 I occupied a space in the Pushkinskaya 10 and there was up to the renovation a musically artistic club for the Boheme, the house of the Petersburg Boheme. </seg>
<seg id="871"> Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how cord with his project &quot;Ucho Van Goga&quot; visited it. </seg>
<seg id="872"> Cord and his friends sang simple songs for playback, wearing tight shirts and to them as was the hottest composer Igor Wdowin today. </seg>
<seg id="873"> As the group began to play live, was from the &quot;Leningrad.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="874"> The mountain moderated many programmes before the time of &quot;Halli Galli.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="875"> We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but the fundamentals he learned from us. </seg>
<seg id="876"> The gallery &quot;D&quot; or &quot;137 club&quot; Griboedov &quot;have their origin in the the clinic. </seg>
<seg id="877"> Our employees and guests. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I am a hero of the last century, as a culture still meant something. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In 2000 there was a poll in the press, the award &quot;personalities of our city.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="880"> I won in the category &quot;artist of the year,&quot; and I was reached at the peak. </seg>
<seg id="881"> It is not easy to work in new times under old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="882"> In this day and age, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: You can be famous, without having to make a cultural contribution. </seg>
<seg id="883"> - Your work has a distinctive style. </seg>
<seg id="884"> - Many of my pictures are true pearls and the timeliness and thoroughness of the idea. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I am an exhibition with the theme &quot;the Russian Museum as clowns.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="886"> Clowns are timeless. </seg>
<seg id="887"> Earlier I was socially, but now it pains and is afraid to be so. </seg>
<seg id="888"> In all this a clown and loses his tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="889"> I love the grotesque, and I have bizarre ideas. </seg>
<seg id="890"> For example, we save the world by specifying that everyone has to dress up in full. </seg>
<seg id="891"> Everyone is now on the clothes and the exterior and the interior of the people. </seg>
<seg id="892"> But perhaps we should not be a human hand, but should he spit in the face. </seg>
<seg id="893"> The deception by dressing up. </seg>
<seg id="894"> Recently, we saw you in the role of the urban barrel organ player. - A cultural city should have as a hero. </seg>
<seg id="895"> Who, if I fail? </seg>
<seg id="896"> - Commercial art can also be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="897"> Today - must be careful commercial art, considerate and flattering. </seg>
<seg id="898"> We see the disintegration of the cultures. </seg>
<seg id="899"> Earlier, the large groups of people: the bohemians loved one and the ordinary people. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Now there are micro communities, and it is difficult to please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="901"> I am not a hundred dollar bill, which will please everyone. </seg>
<seg id="902"> Now you have to consider you, if you will. </seg>
<seg id="903"> Every cult star now has about 100 followers. </seg>
<seg id="904"> - In the presence of Stas Michał Ilow but several thousand! </seg>
<seg id="905"> - Come to him abandoned women, sexually plays a role in the social sphere. </seg>
<seg id="906"> For cultural reasons, 300 individuals and 10 thousand, so there is less money management, and everything is. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I have supporters, and the most important thing is not to cheat and not destroy what has been achieved. </seg>
<seg id="908"> In my youth I have painted these pictures, which were in a collectors even in a number of the works of Falk and Lario Now. </seg>
<seg id="909"> I started with images that are usually only at the end of the career. </seg>
<seg id="910"> Today, there are often misunderstandings. </seg>
<seg id="911"> It says: intellectual culture and consumer culture. </seg>
<seg id="912"> Consumption has no culture, that is something quite different. </seg>
<seg id="913"> I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived and died in poverty and refused money in order to be able to paint. </seg>
<seg id="914"> This is the culture that I support. </seg>
<seg id="915"> - What is missing kirill Petersburg? </seg>
<seg id="916"> - Good cultural experts. </seg>
<seg id="917"> They say: Diener- culture. </seg>
<seg id="918"> But not all of them can deal with culture. </seg>
<seg id="919"> In the real czar, it was different, because a lot of culture, but they understood that are perhaps not the right experts. </seg>
<seg id="920"> In Moscow, there are currently good advisers. </seg>
<seg id="921"> In St. Petersburg, we have what might be the experts, but they are blocked by the way, because it takes hochrangigerer experts, the former properly assess and pave the way for them. </seg>
<seg id="922"> Now, only one&apos;s own taste. </seg>
<seg id="923"> The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they say honestly that they are not all contemporary art and therefore need to find some painters to adopt other museums. </seg>
<seg id="924"> - What is for you? </seg>
<seg id="925"> - St. Petersburg, the Capital of culture in Moscow; there is a lot more culture and a breeding ground. </seg>
<seg id="926"> On our stones can grow art is difficult. </seg>
<seg id="927"> We need a cultural ground because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not true. </seg>
<seg id="928"> In Europe, there are many people who visit exhibitions and concerts. </seg>
<seg id="929"> We have a lot less. </seg>
<seg id="930"> Art must be back in fashion, as at the beginning of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="931"> The project is funded by grants from the city of St. Petersburg </seg>
<seg id="932"> Born in space </seg>
<seg id="933"> Earth at risk. </seg>
<seg id="934"> Global warming or collision with killer asteroid. </seg>
<seg id="935"> Of space ships carrying Erdbewohnern on the search for a replacement. </seg>
<seg id="936"> In order to save humanity, the important question of how we can reproduce in the weightlessness or the spare planet? </seg>
<seg id="937"> Many there is no choice in my opinion. </seg>
<seg id="938"> In fact, there are only two real planet, we could at least kādu hypothetical. </seg>
<seg id="939"> &quot;Mars and Venus,&quot; says the scientific staff of the Astronomical Institute of Šternberk Vladimir Surdin. </seg>
<seg id="940"> While the conditions on Mars relatively enjoyable, on the surface of Venus a temperature of 500 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="941"> Life would be only in height or in the orbit of Venus, in space. </seg>
<seg id="942"> The researchers first dealt with the issue of reproduction in space on the flora. </seg>
<seg id="943"> A half-century earlier already carried out experiments with plants. </seg>
<seg id="944"> The fourth generation of the orbiting bred peas did not differ at all from the terraqueous species. </seg>
<seg id="945"> It was followed by the breeding of insects, from tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit. </seg>
<seg id="946"> In 1979 quail eggs were sent into space to explore how the weightlessness on the development of embryos. </seg>
<seg id="947"> It is becoming a normal chicks. </seg>
<seg id="948"> But then the trouble begins. </seg>
<seg id="949"> &quot;The problem is that the chicks themselves; it must be able to stand on its legs and start to move,&quot; said the laboratory director of the Institute for medical and biological problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew. </seg>
<seg id="950"> Without solid underground chicks have been. </seg>
<seg id="951"> Ten hours later stumpften fully the instincts of the newborn. </seg>
<seg id="952"> The chicks were not reacting to light and sounds. </seg>
<seg id="953"> She died four days later. </seg>
<seg id="954"> &quot;Twice we could slip chicks and did it, because it is simply impossible to work with them,&quot; Vladimir Sychew considers the failed experiment with the chicks in space. </seg>
<seg id="955"> The last breeding cages animals flew into orbit 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="956"> In the spring of 2013 will continue the experiments. </seg>
<seg id="957"> However, on the Biosatelliten &quot;and&quot; are only same-sex species. </seg>
<seg id="958"> There was an experiment with rats that fertilized already have been sent into space. </seg>
<seg id="959"> In principle, there was nothing special. </seg>
<seg id="960"> &quot;It was with the Biosatelliten again, but it was only a single experiment, and the research must continue,&quot; said Vladimir Sychew. </seg>
<seg id="961"> After the landing, the space rats. </seg>
<seg id="962"> The issue of reproduction in space could be resolved so far. </seg>
<seg id="963"> The task is difficult. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Animals that are taken from their natural habitat, simply cannot follow their reproductive behavior. </seg>
<seg id="965"> Unlike animals could in. </seg>
<seg id="966"> Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can generate a similar emotional background. </seg>
<seg id="967"> For ethical considerations are not carried out such experiments. </seg>
<seg id="968"> But women fly for 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="969"> The greatest risk in Tereshkova. </seg>
<seg id="970"> The Wertvollste with humanity, is the female body. </seg>
<seg id="971"> Our gull flew, and no one on earth would they can answer the following question: Übersteht space flight? </seg>
<seg id="972"> This flight, will be able to bring a child into the world? </seg>
<seg id="973"> &quot;Finally, no one answered that question,&quot; says space veteran Tang Watschnadse. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In June 1964, just a year after their space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="975"> The child&apos;s father, Jan Nikola, was also. </seg>
<seg id="976"> In 1988, the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja who twice in orbit, and is even working outside the space vehicle, a son. </seg>
<seg id="977"> Nevertheless, there remains a risk. </seg>
<seg id="978"> We have only very few cosmonaut, where after long flights go well and they got healthy offspring. </seg>
<seg id="979"> &quot;The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights into orbit,&quot; concludes cosmonaut Valery Poliakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation. </seg>
<seg id="980"> And yet the human race for new ways in biotechnology, the radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="981"> The hydraulic laboratory in the cosmonaut training center is a compulsory station during the flight. </seg>
<seg id="982"> Here in limbo win the cosmonaut routine for work in the open space. </seg>
<seg id="983"> The water is the weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="984"> Although adults water as a pleasant experience, it is a foreign environment, but infants feel water as a natural element. </seg>
<seg id="985"> It is as if the small Ichtyander testimony that rose from life on the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="986"> There is a connection between the fact that a child is about 9 months in the belly of the mother in the amniotic fluid, and that it can get easier to water. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In principle this is logical, since from birth to the first swimming just 2 weeks. </seg>
<seg id="988"> &quot;This is too little time to forget something,&quot; says Babyschwimmlehrerin Marina Aksenowa. </seg>
<seg id="989"> While for a newborn child is the weightlessness of a much more natural state, is not the woman without gravity. </seg>
<seg id="990"> In a state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles very quickly and so that is the ability to extract the child. </seg>
<seg id="991"> Okay, we deal with geburtseinleitende tools. </seg>
<seg id="992"> For example, the birth could take place in a special chamber in order to extract the child. </seg>
<seg id="993"> &quot;But what happens then?&quot; Is not the important issue of Valery Poliakov. </seg>
<seg id="994"> On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="995"> Without feeling the gravitational pull of the organism can form the skeleton and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="996"> A newborn child could not be put in orbit as an adult for training in a. </seg>
<seg id="997"> He is just missing what is of fundamental importance to his life. </seg>
<seg id="998"> &quot;This experiment that we make together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will lead to a disabled person, a complete non-conformist will bring people to the world,&quot; says the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute for medical and biological problems RAN, Igor Pestow. </seg>
<seg id="999"> So far, the birth of children in space theory. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> At some point it becomes reality, but if the people in their space ships to a distant planet, which is a home for their offspring born in space. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> Nkú chief: control of the Black system through the fault of the failed policy </seg>
<seg id="1002"> The Czech Republic, in the context of public contracts on good supervisory bodies and adequate laws, but in their application. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> In the conversation for Aktuá ln.cz says that the Vice-President of the Supreme control office (Nejvyí kontrolní úad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> &quot;A law is never perfect, but it must be used correctly - and I think this is not the case with us,&quot; said of the current situation. </seg>
<seg id="1005"> A similar result is to be a common control by Czech and German firms. </seg>
<seg id="1006"> As bad practice on the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas for so-called &quot;Black system.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1007"> The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS would annoy the entrepreneurs with controls - so the system is banned or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1008"> &quot;A law must have valid, and if something is forbidden by law, then simply cannot come from the government&apos;s chairman, and the monitoring office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, an obstacle in his work,&quot; Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1009"> At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a common Czech / German project, the both countries &quot;laws on public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> What was it? </seg>
<seg id="1011"> It is a parallel investigation, with which we started about two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> Simply put, it is important that establishes the European legislative to handle public contracts to build the national legislations, and finally, there is the real practical application.. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> All of this we have compared with each other, and although the examination is not yet complete, we have seen very interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws are perhaps a little &quot;strict and perfect,&quot; but the actual application is in Germany in some parameters better. </seg>
<seg id="1014"> This confirms that it is not new, and more detailed rules. We must deal with the actual application of the law. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> How can you help the project for you? What emerges from this project? </seg>
<seg id="1016"> It is precisely this kind of joint control could help to stop us constantly to the laws and the reduction and balance of thresholds, if this did not seem particularly positive. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> Efficiency means one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) to buy and illegal enrichment or even criminal acts. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> But the lowering of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we achieve this goal. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> It may even be that the system in this way, only the excessive burden &quot;paperwork&quot; and those who look for loopholes in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system, as if the threshold values higher. </seg>
<seg id="1020"> They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech public procurement law. </seg>
<seg id="1021"> How does the control system in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1022"> There is a similar authority as our NKÚ, or the system works differently? </seg>
<seg id="1023"> To as far as the authorities, the German counterpart the NKÚ the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar to us, and also on a college, which will be formed only slightly different. Basically, both authorities are similar. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> The skills are comparable to a certain extent, with Germany, however, a federal state, which means that there is also in the individual federal states - is the German system is different from ours. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> The BRH can only monitor federal funding, which is our state funds. </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Public funds is managed by the counties and municipalities, are subject to the control of the national courts of auditors. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> As regards the German legislation is easier than ours? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> In general I would compare it without specifics reluctant. Nevertheless Germany is in some ways, often described as a model, but say that Germany in particular is better. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> That is because the auditors are better? </seg>
<seg id="1030"> That is certainly not, but I don&apos;t particularly like, such comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="1031"> It should be noted here that even those countries that have a model for us, are also struggling with problems. </seg>
<seg id="1032"> Otherwise, they would have nothing to work with our authority, isn&apos;t it? </seg>
<seg id="1033"> As regards the Czech legislation, your authority had the revision of the procurement law, do you feel any impact? </seg>
<seg id="1034"> In view of the fact that this amendment is only a short time in power, it is not yet in our tests. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> As our controls, you have to be here with some delay. </seg>
<seg id="1036"> Impact we feel in the preparatory phase of the future controls - we have the new instrument of control &quot;detection of risks of inefficiency&quot; and examined with this almost 14,000 public contracts and here, the changes will affect change, of course, the threshold values, modified the conditions for certain types of contracts, etc. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> You can see the adoption of this law is more positive, or the system will be burdened with additional bureaucracy? </seg>
<seg id="1038"> I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> It may occur, however, the problem is that the rules be &quot;tough&quot; and can no longer be met. </seg>
<seg id="1040"> Under the previous rules are that they a Prfung underlined people against the carrier (for example, in the event of an operational programme of regional policy, the regional council) an are not accountable to any breach of the public procurement law a violation of budgetary discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> But it is to make the law more stringent? </seg>
<seg id="1042"> I do not believe that in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not to punish those who have made a formal errors, which does not affect the actual decision-making. </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Such a system, only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> Where is the solution? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> We say first of all, what is not the. </seg>
<seg id="1047"> The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS entrepreneurs would bother with controls of the so-called &quot;Black system&quot; - what does that mean exactly? </seg>
<seg id="1048"> The system is banned or permitted? </seg>
<seg id="1049"> A law must have valid, and if something is forbidden by law, then simply cannot come from the government&apos;s chairman, and the monitoring office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, an obstacle in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> He can say: &quot;we will change the law and allow the thing,&quot; but he cannot say that we do so, as if it were nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain operations - and this is for the protection of the public competition. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer is excluded due to procedural errors alone. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> The law will never be perfect, but it must be used correctly - and that is what we are lacking. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> On the streets, there is some danger, but mostly they are dry. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> On the streets of the Czech Republic is partly snowfall and the danger. </seg>

<seg id="1106"> Imon Ornest: our concerts we want positive energy gain </seg>
<seg id="1107"> What do you think about the fact that is to take place in less than a month of the world? </seg>
<seg id="1108"> This is one of those disasters, we human so to start up again. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> With our band the T T do we tell us more about fun and that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1110"> Also in December, an unique project with three concerts at the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> Can you imagine the project closer to our readers? </seg>
<seg id="1112"> It is a nationwide fundraising event, which we have been planning two years. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> To this end, we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, the end of December 21 is projected at 11:10. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> The day before, on 20 December, from 21:00 p.m. at the same time, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava. </seg>
<seg id="1115"> The end of the concerts will be around at the time, on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is located in a time zone 12 hours ahead of us, the Mayan calendar ends. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> Who is criticising this idea? </seg>
<seg id="1117"> I was then, we have developed the idea, together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> In doing so, we do not want to collect only enough positive energy in order to prevent the world, but we also want to consider, together with the public about what state we this world Mimiola our children. </seg>
<seg id="1119"> At the end of the Mayan calendar, we also have an unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key supporters against the world, can help with the purchase of www.e tap.cz people. </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The band the T T, together with other performers also the so-called anthem against the world with the title &quot;world comes from.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1121"> The anthem is already very popular on YouTube. It will resound to the benefit concerts? </seg>
<seg id="1122"> Of course, at the very end, provided that everything works and will not take place in the world... </seg>
<seg id="1123"> The anthem to be sung by all actors at all three concerts at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="1124"> In addition to the anthems live together in a direct connection from the Czech television. </seg>
<seg id="1125"> The text of the anthem comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, including Xindl X sings with... </seg>
<seg id="1126"> How did you start working with two? </seg>
<seg id="1127"> We also cooperate with other figures in the Czech cultural scene, which that we realize many charity events and concerts... </seg>
<seg id="1128"> We are trying to these people hard in our projects. </seg>
<seg id="1129"> It has transpired that are most interested in cooperating with us, and have fun. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> What purpose does the proceeds of the concerts to benefit the world? </seg>
<seg id="1131"> For the establishment of the accessible education center Studeo, on which we are already working together with the club six years T in Jedlika Institute. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> The students of the Jedlika Institute are regularly by teachers who help them in different leisure activities. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> As the students themselves do not have the resources to go to the, we want to help them in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> In the context of the completion of the Jedlika Institute is intended to create a separate building, in which we move with this project. </seg>
<seg id="1135"> At every concert several groups and performers. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> According to what criteria you have chosen? </seg>
<seg id="1137"> We wanted to put together a programme that appeals to all generations, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> In Prague, for example, China Yovkov enter support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The T T, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý. </seg>
<seg id="1139"> Everything else you on the website www.kpks.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Similar &quot;big events&quot; are planned for the future? </seg>
<seg id="1141"> In May, we are for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we are preparing an interesting programme with interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> Next year we want to be like in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are in the United States - would also like to combine this with appearances in Washington and Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Their overseas plans are not small, you already have occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1144"> The T T is, however, a group composed of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> How do you deal with these logistical and organisational trips? </seg>
<seg id="1146"> It is not as bad as it seems at first sight. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the hold. We also need to haul many instruments suitcase and other luggage... </seg>
<seg id="1148"> Nevertheless, it always worked without problems, SA and British Airways were always prepared very well for us, that I have sometimes surprised some. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems. </seg>
<seg id="1150"> Through your foreign trips you have to compare the situation in the various countries with, as there are people with disabilities, etc. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> As you have seen these things? </seg>
<seg id="1152"> After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than ours, we were witnessing in Russia in the East, that is still in its infancy. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> To Prague, Moscow is not totally disabled, where it is still unusual, if someone is in a wheelchair in the city centre. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> It is not yet, of course, that vorlässt a wheelchair users, for example, in the elevator. </seg>
<seg id="1155"> Fortunately, there are also clubs that try to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1156"> And in what ways we need to catch up with the more developed countries? </seg>
<seg id="1157"> There are many things on which we depend on... </seg>
<seg id="1158"> It should be noted, however, that an improvement in the situation of the efforts of those concerned. </seg>
<seg id="1159"> In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal for people with severe disabilities self-cut move in public space, go to the museum can use toilets etc. </seg>
<seg id="1160"> But it is not usual that actively participates in a larger group of disabled people in the public arena, we are with the band the T T slightly ahead of the West. </seg>
<seg id="1161"> Public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only when one of our own worldleading athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, are things really start to change. </seg>
<seg id="1162"> So far, these are only isolated cases of particularly determined personalities. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> The T T is currently very popular. But if we go back a couple of years: What was your motivation in 1998 to get a band? </seg>
<seg id="1164"> Then I began as a supervisor in the Jedlika Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something. </seg>
<seg id="1165"> And since I myself am musicians and, together with a colleague, I have a music AG. </seg>
<seg id="1166"> Oh, and over time, as the moderator, Láa Angelovi, likes to say, a little out of control (laughs). </seg>
<seg id="1167"> The band became known in recent years, would you? </seg>
<seg id="1168"> It is true that the cooperation with well-known singers helped us, and we have started to campaign actively for us. </seg>

<seg id="1175"> There are few truly unique things, and I would venture to say that T T. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> The first impression that the audience usually has, of course, is a pity; it is only natural. </seg>
<seg id="1177"> But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not isolated and abandoned, we should regret. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> There are people who live a full life and can develop, if they have the necessary resources. </seg>
<seg id="1179"> I always say that if people with disabilities something, not just for them is a step forward, but for the whole of society. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> It was also helpful for this success, that you are a tough boss, as we hear from many people? </seg>
<seg id="1181"> If you want to make something good, we must make no compromises on many things, and we should also ask for a certain discipline. </seg>

<seg id="1195"> Poland and the space. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Poland was admitted last week at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the member States of the European space Agency (ESA) as a member of this space easy authority. Poland is the second member country of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which took place on 12 November 2008 ESA member). </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Poland began in 1994 and participated in a close cooperation with the European Space Agency ESA projects in the next several years. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> The path of Poland into space, however, began much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> Even before the Second World War II Polish space enthusiasts with the space, and they were not always understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> I remember of the lecture by A. ternfeld on 6 December 1933 in Warsaw, which the author thought from his pioneering work &quot;entrance to the cosmonautics.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) but the audience cold, and after years ternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had only shown interest in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> Ternfeld won in 1934 for &quot;entrance to the cosmonautics&quot; by Robert Esnault Pelttari and André Louis Hirsch, Prix REPS Hirsch. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) was an important supporter of astronomy and space. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Gadomskis globally recognized contribution to the development of the space has been acknowledged by, among other things, that one of the crater on the erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> In 1925 was built in Poland a railway trolley, which was planned for a rocket engine. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> The author of the draft, and the details of this project have unfortunately been unknown. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to start or the brakes of the trolley. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> The information can come only from the contemporary press. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> In 1933 the Polish infantry, with raketenbetriebenen purpose-as began. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> The research, the Institute Komórka Tech Niki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> From the documents show that the research was down to the stage of practical tests. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> But the research was then interrupted by the invading German Wehrmacht. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> In 1937, in the press of. Rohoziski originating draft photoelectric hunting rocket, and the following year, he joined the &quot;raki 生Eta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza&quot; of the author Leliwa Krzywoblocky. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> Both projects dealing with the military use of the rocket propulsion. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of missile technology from passing scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo Naukowy). </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The Committee was established in 1937, after two years of work has been finished his work by the beginning of the war. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> Another article on space appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish aerospace company (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press. </seg>
<seg id="1219"> The first mention of this company is 1954 in the November issue of the journal Problemy, in the four major articles of the space. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to a space company. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> At the time there was the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that would have the space exploration future. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> Even at its inception in 1956, the Polish space Society PTA membership based on the 1951 International Federation for space, and indeed, the PTA in autumn 1956 member. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> The following year was the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Deputy chairman of the International Federation for space. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> This post he held until his death in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> Since 1956, the PTA took part in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (raki Eta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> The first type, 1, was completed in 1957, the first race took place on 10 October 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> The missile with a maximum altitude of 1800 m was 80 cm long and weighed just 5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> Later, an improved version, the brillantes 1 A, built, and 1959 in the Bledowska Desert flight tests began with the two-stage rocket más brillantes 2. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> A further stage of development should be able to make real scientific work - the rocket más brillantes 34 should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and for the observation of high-altitude winds. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> In 1962, but, has been halted further development. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> Successor to the first missiles of the type RM was developed in the years 1962 to 1965 Meteor- 1 rocket. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> The rocket was conceived as a two-stage rocket, its total length of 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> From this developed three types (Meteor- 1 A, 1 B and - 1 C), which manifested in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> The Meteor- 1 a rocket had a room with 0.4 litres capacity, Meteor- 1 B 0.34 litre and Meteor- 1 C for 0.62 litres. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The maximum altitude for all three types of 37 km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> In the years 1965 to 1968 was developed in the aviation institute which Meteor- 2 rocket, whose first flight tests began in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> Meteor- 2 has a launch weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg in a height of about 60 km. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> After the versions were built Meteor- 2 H and Meteor- 3. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> Also worth mentioning is the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, followed two years later the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> Poland participated in the framework of the cosmos programme in space research with Soviet satellite, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Hermaszewski current legislation after the Czechs second interwetten cosmonaut Vladimir Remek. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> Last week, the Constitutional Court of the law on charitable work. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> That decision provoked a lively debate among the public. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> It is interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> &quot;The liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world based on the principle of unregulated economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> In effect, this means that the individual economies are in constant conflict with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> The this is the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with rampant financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> Due to the large differences of the value of work (wages) leads to price. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> It is a condition in which the manufacturer is trying to compete with cheaper imported goods in economic competition, by undercutting the competition &quot;&quot; in order to grab a larger market share and to increase its profits. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> This means on a large scale for most companies to move their production abroad or buy cheap, or give up their business. The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with high labour costs. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> Because private capital no social responsibility and therefore not responsible for what he is necessarily caused unemployment, rising government spending. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> This situation is exacerbated by the fact that the two entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and the damage they have caused overall economic and social damage. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> This situation is well known, so that specific statistics are unnecessary at this point. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> The reckless practice of private capital in the individual economies creates a situation in which the governments are forced to compete with each other, in order to artificially reduce the level of social security of its own people and to attract foreign capital into the country. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> In other words: governments provide their own people without regard to the social consequences of the private capital. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> This is particularly in changes to existing laws. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> The aim of these measures is to force their own people to accept the dictates of the private sector, particularly in the field of wages. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> This is done through economic coercion in long-term unemployment, partly by reducing workers &quot;rights. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> The result is increased poverty and widening disparities between rich and poor. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> In Germany there have been several years since public food outlets for the poor, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> The number of people affected is already in the millions. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> As a result of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy is regularly to cases where workers receive a salary so low that the state must increase their income to the subsistence level. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> Such a scandal was also in the case of the German Bundestag revealed auxiliaries. </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The austerity measures virtually all the EU southern states will no doubt be on the same condition, which people are being forced under the pressure of a catastrophic crash their social levels, to emigrate (as in the 19th century), or for a pittance to languish on the margins of society and hope that at some private investment capital flow into the country. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> Here, the question naturally arises as to how this capital? </seg>
<seg id="1267"> If it comes from another EU country, only the poverty from one country to another; or the capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa at all for a fraction of the European wages. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> This applies to all of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Liberal theories and media ad nauseam claim that the state must not be involved with capital in its own economy, and that a planned economy to economic disaster. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Private capital narrowly insists on his position that the state should not intervene to direct the economy. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> Then you have to wonder whether the policy does not affect private capital and the entire state in their own selfish interests or draws. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> Here is the clear answer: yes. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all states. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, of mutual benefit, legislation in virtually anything criminal, but nothing is punishable. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> In Germany, the reality is that a State Department for lack of finances private, with the industry of legal businesses with the drafting of legislative proposals. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> This legislation is passed in the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> All violence is no longer the people from the western constitutions, as, but by strong financial groups who prefer their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Obviously the liberal democracies are currently a situation that Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic during Caesar&apos;s and &quot;describes:&quot; the state has been understood for a long time in the, and the offices were occupied by force. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Against bribes, illegal or fraudulent use of benefits with stone and sword. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> Corruption has grown unchecked, and the people with boughted votes went to the polls ...&quot;&quot; people with character not applied for posts as a result of this decline for eight months, so that the state had no consul ...&quot;&quot; You really began to talk about it, that is the only medicine an autocracy in this difficult situation, and that a strong man ...&quot; Appian thought is to be in, but the strong man was eventually Caesar, democracy permanently replaced by the autocracy. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> As it turns out, is today&apos;s society, as well as in ancient times based on of the ruthless preference of one&apos;s own advantage, without looking at overall societal interests. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Private capital by its very nature, is not in a position to see the benefit of society as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The result, now, as then, is an unparalleled decadence of the elites, who are not in the slightest for deeper reforms. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> The cause for the rise of fascism and communism, we must therefore in the indiscriminate liberalisation of of the economies in the 19th and 20th century look. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> Of the, the regime in favor of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause, in the next round. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> Especially appalling is the fact that today&apos;s elites in the future potential losses of hundreds of thousands of human lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, we are today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know it from the older and more recent history, in complete ignorance. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The repeal of the law on voluntary work is no solution, at least not lasting. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Under pressure from the global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the level of social security of the population. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> This trend is a systemic nature. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase the capital of the state of the economy, the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in the company in favor of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Israel: laboratory of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> ...&quot; that there is nothing that could arise from violence or Sting sings in the song&quot; fragile, the most ever chorus: ...&quot; so that we do not forget how fragile we are.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1293"> &quot;If my sons were no wars, there would be no,&quot; says the dying Gutele continuity Schnaper, wife of Mayer Rothschild, in 1849 </seg>
<seg id="1294"> After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, there were a host of reactions. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> The there are those who stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defence, while the Palestinians as terrorists; the others support the Palestinians, to argue with the racism of the State of Israel, with to the Palestinian Arabs committed genocide and the State of Israel as a terrorist. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> At this point I don&apos;t to write about who is in these recurring waves of killing someone who is guilty and who ultimately victims; the today&apos;s inhabitants of Israel including the self-rule territories in the current political situation, and have not seen the start of the violence. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> My concern is to give readers a look behind the scenes, look who&apos;s 95 years of tension (from Balfour declaration in November 1917) in the small parcels of land in the Middle East in particular. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> My thoughts are based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from this and go from my own understanding of who or what group of people affected by the events of modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> The history of mankind is primarily a story of the struggle for power. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> In every era, we can see an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> What is less obvious is whether they really were always those people themselves, of their autonomy, or whether someone was behind her throne, who drew their actions on a vorbestimmtes goal. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> We must admit that we live in a time when the world&apos;s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power within the life span of a generation. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Under these astronomical is a particularly rich families, which could be described as head of the octopus (I do not know if there is someone above them, but I do not rule out) - the Rothschilds. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> Not much is written about them. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> It is understandable. </seg>
<seg id="1306"> The first (Reuters press agency) was of the Rothschilds already in the 90 s of the 19th century, bought in order to prevent the linking its name with hochkriminellen deeds, in the context of the consolidation of its power, the propagation of their assets, or both. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks in the world, and the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they lead wars or equip themselves to this (before the attack on Afghanistan, there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq, there were 5 countries, after the fall Ghaddafis remained only four, but in the meantime, the central Bank of Russia&apos;s government has). </seg>
<seg id="1308"> Anyone who has ever tried to oppose this family, had to pay with their lives for it. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Rothschilds as central Bank, Bank of America during the civil war began to issue their own (read: official) notes and was murdered in 1865 in a theatre. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> J.f. Kennedy, began to issue their own banknotes and wanted to abolish the Federal Reserve - he was assassinated in 1963; Mr Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned 1936, after the Fed wanted to sue for triggering the Great Depression in 1929. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> The global appetite for power of the Rothschilds, in the years 1859 - 1871 to formulate a plan to free up three world wars by Albert Masonic spades, an of the 33th and the highest degree of recognition. </seg>
<seg id="1312"> The first war aimed to eliminate the big royalist states, Europe should be broken by the second war, in particular Britain&apos;s colonial rule, and the third war to reduce the world&apos;s population to around 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their amenities and luxury and would not use so many resources), create an universal religion (the ecumenism is nothing more than) and finally lead to the assumption of absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1313"> The method by which the group of the richest families is working with the Rothschilds at the head, triggering a crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (or from chao - order out of chaos). </seg>
<seg id="1314"> These solutions are wrong and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the creation of the Federal Reserve, so that crises like the one of them in 1907 triggered repeat). </seg>
<seg id="1315"> After it was managed by the murder of the Hapsburg throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, triggering World War I, they destroyed the Russian empire by the Bolshevik Revolution. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> The First World war ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified surrender of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian Tsar&apos;s empire the war was not necessary), then the dissolution of the Central European superpower Austria. </seg>
<seg id="1317"> In order to be able to the Second World war, the bankers by the policy could create a latent conflict situation by Germany with huge war reparations, which they created the condition of impoverished masses, so they had to only palming the Germans a sufficiently strong leader who named the guilty, and offered simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multinational state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which should be the function of a fifth column, and also played in order to the fire of war. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in a branch of the establishment of a Jewish state, as turned on the historic area with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion). </seg>
<seg id="1319"> The aforementioned Balfour declaration created the conditions for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were the first clashes with the local Arab population. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> There were terrorist attacks on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> The Second world War broke out, and whether Hitler, ran aground off the chain, which it initially had kept the international bankers, or whether everything has gone according to plan, it is difficult to assess, in any event, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps, the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel was founded in 1948, was to the, as well as by the war reparations from Germany for the Second World war, the creation of the state of Israel, the creation of the focal point for the third World war. </seg>
<seg id="1323"> If we will be in the international bankers to unleash this war, the Jewish people victims of the Second World war II in the front line of battle, this time together with the Arab and Muslim population in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of conflict and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think of how sharply divided the people of Israel&apos;s supporters and opponents). </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Who is the guilty party and who the victims in the conflict between Palestinians and Vojeans Israelites, where it is wrong in an endless cycle of violence, which was at the beginning of the greed and their quest for global power? </seg>
<seg id="1326"> We must differentiate between the people of Israel and its leadership, but the international bankers in Israel as well as for us, the people, only their own candidates for election. </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The current Prime Minister of Israel, Netanyahu, the hawk, is a typical example of a faschismusanfälligen, international bankers loyal devoted politician who does everything to spark a war with Iran, which, in the of Iran&apos;s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly escalate into a global conflict, and because of the Iran&apos;s control over only 2 miles wide Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of global oil supplies, could lead to the destruction of the world economy. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> In the light of the words of David Rockefellers in 1994: &quot;the only thing we need is an across-the-board crisis, and the people will welcome the new world order.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1329"> In its presentation of the new world order is a world of masters and slaves. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> A world in which the rest of the human population of a small group of financial aristocrats. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> A world in which every newborn is implanted in the birth of a chip to submit this system of total control. </seg>
<seg id="1332"> &quot;And it is that the kids and the Great, the rich and the poor, the Free and the servants of a malt oak give their right hand or in their forehead, that no one can buy or sell, he was because, namely the name of the animal or the number of his name. </seg>
<seg id="1333"> Here is wisdom, who has, consider the number of the animal. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> Because it is a human figure, and his number is sechshundertsechsundsechzig. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1335"> The film Argo: When&apos;s the worst that Hollywood call </seg>
<seg id="1336"> In November 1979, a mob demonstrating Islamist students occupied the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> They called for the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled for their release after the revolution in the United States, which for decades had maintained the patronage of his regime. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> For the American Government out of this situation, there was no positive way - she could not afford to throw the Shah, as this would have damaged the confidence of their allies in other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> At the same time, it was not in a position in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime to secure the release of the hostages. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt by the hostage liberation made it even worse. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> The diplomats were released after 444 days, after negotiations mediated by the Algerian government. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> The fate of the hostages home a wave of solidarity and antiiranischer moods. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The film, the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story, which gave the U.S. a small part of victory. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> Just before the occupation of the embassy six embassy staff were able to escape. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador. </seg>
<seg id="1347"> The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from Iran; it helped them an extravagant story for covering up their true identity - they with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film, which allegedly visited locations in the country for a science fiction film. </seg>

<seg id="1349"> The experts for &quot;Exfiltration,&quot; Tony Mendez, developed plan, Hollywood&apos;s cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> This was the camouflage credible, published articles about this film project in journals, there were held press conferences, and the fictional production company had a real office. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> Afflecks film is an unique combination of several film genres. </seg>
<seg id="1353"> On the one hand, it is a realistic political thriller, but also a so-called &quot;Aquascapers Movie&quot; is, the story of a successful job, such as the film Ocean&apos;s Eleven. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> This change in the film&apos;s mood levels - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence showing iconic contemporary photographs, and also in the film version of the same situations, there are no major differences). </seg>
<seg id="1355"> On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, therefore, the ironic and slightly exaggerate. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the conference table, the official corridors, on the phone... </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Ben Affleck succeeded with this film a remarkable start to his career. </seg>
<seg id="1358"> From a belächelten actor has become a respected director, and also as an actor he is no longer the target of ironic comments. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> Argo is his third feature film in the no children (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010). </seg>
<seg id="1360"> At the same time, it is Afflecks first film, which is not in the local Boston by director. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that contrasted this director&apos;s previous films from the Hollywood standard. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> Affleck demonstrates this sense but also in Argo, where Tehran is &quot;played&quot; by Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1363"> The best scenes of the in the streets and demonstrate the reconstruction of events that have taken place - the main sequence of the storming of the embassy in its clarity is very impressive, and it conveys the sense of confusion and the unpredictability that occurs when signalizations moves the story. </seg>
<seg id="1364"> A similar effect Affleck and his team also in fictional scenes (the wrong film crew at a bazaar in Tehran). </seg>
<seg id="1365"> Too much plot in too many places </seg>
<seg id="1366"> The director also had to deal with the fact that the story actually does not offer many exciting scenes in cinematic terms. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> But he working with the little, but sometimes he nachhilft reality - which is not always so elegantly (the scenes in which will avert the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran of a telephone conversation in America, or the chase on the runway, the most fun). </seg>
<seg id="1368"> The weakness of Argo is his overly broad distribution, which is due to the need to show too much to act in too many places. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> Alan Arkin and John Goodman are charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, their figures but deserved more space, but they are in the film is far from alone. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> Afflecks film loses a little traction. It is a movie, with some interest, and the design and the age of a thriller from 70 to approve years. Without style. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> However, he awakens enthusiasm. </seg>
<seg id="1372"> Until today in some way as a reminder of a living piece of history and as proof of how excessive but the ideas of the omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services, but it is enough. </seg>
<seg id="1373"> Guidelines for inflating balloons, for bananas and for the circus </seg>
<seg id="1374"> The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, an annual survey on the oddest bank charges, has decided to this year, the most absurd thing regulation or idea from the EU &quot;workshop.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1375"> &quot;This idea brought us the recently put forward by the EU plan to introduce a quota of 40% in the management of large European companies,&quot; said Patrik Nacher, who cares about the organisation of the poll, told the newspaper Právo. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the judgment of the Court of Justice on the harmonisation of insurance rates for men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance, because they are for the insurance companies objectively less risk. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> &quot;Another incredible incursions from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> The actual vote will take place until the end of February 2013, &quot;said Nacher. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> On the controversial EU regulations include the mandatory blending of bioethanol to petrol, which is in its wake naturschädigend, the ban on the mercury thermometer, just because they include a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or the directive on size of chicken cages, because of the eggs this year were much more expensive. </seg>
<seg id="1381"> Criticism in the past, the de facto ban on the use of the term &quot;butter&quot; or even a ban on the sale of traditional light bulbs. </seg>
<seg id="1382"> Bananas are 14 cm long </seg>
<seg id="1383"> The EU machine often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby for trade and industry, whose demands are represented in Brussels in the rule of one or more Member States (the Czech Republic, for example, is trying to push through the demands of Czech banks with veto threat). </seg>
<seg id="1384"> Lobbying interests were also behind that bananas must be the highest in the EU trade class at least 14 cm long and no &quot;curvature anomaly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1385"> The European Commission defended with the argument that they harmonisiere only the fragmented national standards that would impede trade. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> The standards for fruit and vegetables by the EU against the resistance of some countries already have been undermined by pointing out that the existing directives would lead to a waste of food. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> A candidate for the victory in this survey is perhaps the EU regulation last year, which must be provided in accordance with balloons in the sale by saying that children under eight years not inflate the balloon without supervision of an adult. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> The EU, citing an American study, which in accordance with balloons are the leading cause of death of children. </seg>
<seg id="1389"> A similar restriction applies for children up to 14 years in the use of Jahrmarktströten. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> There are also curious ideas at home </seg>
<seg id="1391"> Relatively absurd is also a directive, which concerns the European officials - anyone who has an official function in the EU, must not because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece and must instead use the name Macedonia, FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The server Bankovní poplatky.com in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists laissez-faire in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities, the EU regulation on the volume of food supplies to the territory of a member country. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The EU, so that the maximum volume of food supplies, which could be on the day of our EU accession in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> The Czech Republic crossed then set for canned mushrooms, which we threatened a large fine. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for them, that they have no sea, or from the idea to give grants for applications for funding. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> These ideas but did not come from Brussels, but from Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1397"> &quot;We are disadvantaged by the fact that we have no sea. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> We will be asking for a refund from the EU, &quot;said in the autumn of 2004, the then Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (SSD). </seg>
<seg id="1399"> The argument put forward is that the grain harvest is very high, and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases were overcrowded government camps. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> The Czech Republic to sea ports have another way, the EU should according to Palas paying hundreds of millions of euros. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> Finally, the European Commission, the Czech Republic so far that they organised a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Funding for applications for grants offered communities the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US DEU), specifically, it has to be funds for the establishment of aid money requests to Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> EU: bizarre regulations are the exception </seg>
<seg id="1404"> Regulations in the Member States easy target of criticism, the EU&apos;s efforts to regulate and, hence, efficiency and development of the entire European Union, according to some experts, however, deserves more recognition. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> A serious problem, according to these experts are more the EU grants for projects that have absolutely nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but they were in the budget negotiations by individual Member States. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> Emotions here also calls on the fact that the Czech Republic must fight like other member countries in Brussels about the right to use specific names of traditional products and don&apos;t win this fight it. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> The Czech Republic was able to do so after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the term &quot;Olomoucké tvarůžky&quot; defend the national rum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition with us until the 19th century, but had to our manufacturers in Germany, &quot;Tuzemák.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1408"> The designation &quot;rum may only be used for products from sugar cane distil, not for products from sugar beet. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> In the official list of registered products in the EU are appearing in the company of the world-famous feta cheese, gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham, carp from Pohoelice and now Karlovy Vary, or even the Žatec hops. </seg>
<seg id="1410"> With an EU trademark can boast the Pardubice gingerbread or the Hoicer roles. </seg>
<seg id="1411"> &quot;The people that I want to save the Republic, but I am just an amateur,&quot; said Okamura. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> Mr Senator, how to get the idea to run for the presidency? </seg>
<seg id="1413"> It is not about me, senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> If everything would work in our country without problems, I would run anywhere. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> But I can no longer look at how plundered the Republic for 20 years, as thieves, while increasing people&apos;s taxes and the retirement age. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> I had no ambitions to become a politician. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> But if I see something that I do not like, then I try to propose a solution to change this. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> And while I am over 40, and independent and party-less, I have no other way to influence things, a senator or presidential candidate. </seg>
<seg id="1419"> In the Senate, you have made it and then straight on the road to the castle. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> You do not turn our backs on your constituents? </seg>
<seg id="1421"> I told me the whole time that I will take the fight to for the castle on the outcome of the Senate elections. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> This later clarified and I said that I will run for the presidency, if I am elected senator. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> My goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realise my vision. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The problem is not just that we, as people in the pub and in front of the television, but anyone who wants to change something. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> To confuse then there are the media who want to the, and to lie with the freedom of speech and freedom. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> About me, it was said, for example, that I would impress journalists or that I was an adviser by Jiří Paroubek. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> We talk about your vision. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> The struggle for the castle you have included with the thesis of material and criminal liability of politicians, as well as with retrospective asset declarations about 20 million crowns. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> You have to change laws. </seg>
<seg id="1431"> As President, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can bring legislative proposals. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> How do you solve this problem? </seg>
<seg id="1433"> As a simple citizen, I have endeavoured to keep the travel guide a free trade, and this could be enforced. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The problem is the small-minded politics - someone comes from the right or the left with a good proposal, that&apos;s not on purpose, and that keeps the population only. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> As an independent party, I have a much greater potential to win support from all parties represented in parliament. </seg>
<seg id="1436"> My advantage is that I can take without drawers thinking and party dogma of each party what is the best for our country. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> You see as a person in the policy right or left? </seg>
<seg id="1438"> From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see more on the left. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> For me, this left-right thinking but totally irrelevant. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> For me, it is important that we make progress. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> My point is not whether people on the left or the right, I would like to unite the people. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> I always support any good approach, even if it comes from the KSM or the ODS, and even so will I go against bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1443"> It you, if someone calls you as populists. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> But do not confirm it by what you have just said? </seg>
<seg id="1445"> If you add in a company a business plan, then you have an ideal goal and a vision. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> And that you want to move. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> You can call it as far as populism, but all the proposals, which I have spoken to work in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> But without support in Parliament telepad remain just slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1449"> And so that you are not in politics in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> Or do you think that you, if you talk long enough with the people will be able, for example, the material and impose criminal liability? </seg>
<seg id="1451"> I have no other option. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Politicians, journalists and to convince the public and to try to bring them to our side, to achieve these goals. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> As president, it would be no problem for me to ask the chairman of the parliamentary parties on live TV to the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> And the home-owners may then have to say why they reject. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> A strong personality, which refers to irregularities, can put pressure on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Take the direct election of the President, who was a credit to the public pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> I say very clearly that I am an amateur and I am neither a genius nor an intellectuals. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> I am trying to find allies for my views and visions. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> I started with the policy and just trying to find my programme for the support of the majority. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> I always try to assess the situation for themselves; and if it doesn&apos;t work, then I am in six years in the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> That sounds a little, as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I am not a savior. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> I know that I do not alone, and that is why I have spoken with several famous people on whether they want to run for the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> For example, I have spoken with Radim Janura, but rejected due to. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> In addition, I have supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who exposed the fraud in the sale of light fuel oil. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> My candidacy, I began with the assumption that people are deeply unhappy, but now I am no longer sure. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> Sixty percent of voters have not gone to the polls, and those who have gone, mostly elected representatives of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> In the Senate, we are only two independents. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> The people have chosen such a Senate composition that will be very difficult to implement changes. </seg>
<seg id="1470"> Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision for the direct election of mayors and Bezirkshauptmänner. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Do you think about setting up your own party? </seg>
<seg id="1472"> I have not thought about it, because I don&apos;t have the time to review the past every potential party member, and not have the money. </seg>
<seg id="1473"> I have not even money for the Präsidentenkampagne; on my transparent account for only 20,000 CZK. </seg>
<seg id="1474"> They have no money? </seg>
<seg id="1475"> You talk about asset declarations, what would you? </seg>
<seg id="1476"> I appreciate my private assets to about 60 million CZK. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> In Prague, I have a property with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection, which is worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Kodu Superb, which is worth about one million. And and then I have a few million in the account. </seg>
<seg id="1478"> The Aston Martin was a child&apos;s dream - James Bond has always liked me, as he was driving in the car, gallantly to women, and fighting against evil. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> You are driving an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1480"> They say that you want to change the Republic, but you do not want to invest your own money. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> That is not very convincing. </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I do not have 15 million for the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> Should I do about debt? </seg>
<seg id="1484"> I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that the my program probably does not too much interest. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> And I am not obliged to make the campaign from its own resources. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> The cost of the campaign will gedecktVVPP basically through my salary as a senator. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> But the senators salary, I could not live alone; I could not fund my son the English school, which costs Euro30,000 per month. </seg>
<seg id="1489"> If I wanted to earn money, I would stand for nothing. </seg>
<seg id="1490"> Stay as long as an entrepreneur, to have your livelihood? </seg>
<seg id="1491"> You said that you will return these activities? </seg>
<seg id="1492"> But that does not depend on the level of salary. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> As promised, I have reduced my activities. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> For example, is my deputy CEO of the travel agents in the spring,. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> The people want to see me as a Samaritan, saving the republic. </seg>
<seg id="1496"> But I have to live by. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> Monthly income you were used as an entrepreneur? </seg>
<seg id="1498"> About 200,000 to 400,000, and it remains so. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> As president, I would stop my. </seg>
<seg id="1500"> The full interview can be found in the Saturday edition of Právo. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> Proving MVRDV architects that is not only the real adventure in the head - the example of Spijkenisse and the newly-created books mountain - 2 photos </seg>
<seg id="1502"> &quot;I think the building, it looks futuristic, and finally it is to see something interesting,&quot; said Lisette, Aig, a roadside Passantin. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> And Stefan Spermon, it technicians in a nearby big business, says: &quot;But, it is beautiful, the house.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1504"> But I wonder why we still need a library. </seg>
<seg id="1505"> All have Internet, iPad and e-books. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> No one is voluntarily today in one of these Old Style libraries, right? </seg>
<seg id="1507"> Spijkenisse, a little besichtigungsbedürftige sleeping city on the outskirts of Rotterdam, is a strange record holder. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> The of 80,000 inhabitants, the lowest rate throughout the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> To counter this stupid thing, it was decided a few years ago, to contribute to the general education and the seven fictional bridges that are displayed on the euro notes, as emulate nicely bepinselte concrete miniatures. </seg>
<seg id="1510"> The success of the educational offensive was. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to deal with the Mehmed-pasha Mr: a library needs. </seg>
<seg id="1512"> Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architecture firm MVRDV, master of tollkühnen beam charts and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took up the matter with his usual composure and appeared for the hearing on competition in 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile on his face. </seg>
<seg id="1513"> And while the jury is still out looked nonplussed, and jerked nonchalantly esspecially the cheeky Maas exquisite souvenirs of the size of a pyramid and ended his speech aktionistisch reinforced with the words: &quot;Love municipality!&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1514"> It is, therefore, my proposal for the mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg! </seg>
<seg id="1515"> Nine years later, the of EUR 30 million. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> It is part of a revitalization project, which also underground car park, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> At the beginning of November, the books with the second prize awarded &quot;Best Library of NL 2012.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1518"> The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> This is not the faceless small-town retort, which until now had to offer more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a stunned ugly town hall, behind the of white façades inclined to suspect a dairy factory, a piece of contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="1520"> But above all Spijkenisse, on the first public cultural construction in the history of its existence. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> The long road to book </seg>
<seg id="1522"> The first impression: books El Dorado under glass. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> There is a lift which leads halfway through the hills, but the real space and reading tap the fußläufigen climbing the topography. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> The Sonnenalm glazed interior is bright and clear, the soil and the elegant street lamps unambiguously speak the language of a public square. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> The urban environment is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> It is already looking for parking Bank, dog and boys and girls playing football. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> And books, books, books. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> &quot;Normally the bookshelves along the facade, and a big, dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal,&quot; says Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> We have made the classic room configuration on the head and put the reading area from inside out. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The interior of the books ,&quot; is cleverly used: in the middle are offices, Internet library, Schachclub, environmental centre and Haustechnikzentrale. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> A special pleasure are the black bookshelves, which, are the. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> Look, feel and smell are foreign. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> Even die-hard architects and engineers shake whether use of the unknown. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> &quot;We wanted to work with recycled materials,&quot; said Joop Trou Borst, project manager for the city of Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> And so we came up one day in a friesländischen agricultural business on a suitable waste product from agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> For many years in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields a millimeterdünnes plastic fleece as root. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> It is cheap and efficient. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> The thin textile holds one or two, then it is ready for the rubbish bins. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> For the library was the fleece - for the first time in this volume - forced to four centimetres thick plates. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> Under heat and pressure of the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) to a dark, homogeneous, stress resistant material that smells a little for new cars and a little after athletic footwear. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> After 105 stages has reached the summit. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> At the end of the nearly 500 meters long travels in literature café is not only a fantastic prospect of the city, but also rewarded with Dutch croquettes and eingetopften Ficus trees. </seg>
<seg id="1543"> They provide atmosphere, but above all for the right humidity in literature. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> Donations for the new soul </seg>
<seg id="1545"> &quot;You would not believe it, but this house is in spite of the many glass surfaces a flagship project in terms of ecology,&quot; says Trou Borst. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> It is heated and cooled with geothermal energy. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> Although the books mountain under a glass fall, the sun is shining even on sunny days only briefly to the interior. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> The wide, which is right across the glass façade, serve as shading and much of the sun. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> The room climate is very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> The rest do fully automatic blinds. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT industry, already ventured into the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1552"> Even Lisette, Aig was already there. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> And the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, the Boekenberg even as Spijkenisses &quot;long-overdue soul.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1554"> The reason: In the opening of a few weeks ago, everyone was invited residents to donate a book from his personal collection. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> It is not yet again the optical gaps in the fully stocked library - currently 70,000 - will be filled. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> The idea has taken root. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> The shelves are filled absolutely fed up. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> &quot;Nothing is worse than a half-empty library,&quot; says architect Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> &quot;I think everyone now thanks to our invitation, has residents of a certain relationship with this new house. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Everyone knows that his book is part of the building. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> And if it is just an ornament. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> This is the King discipline that MVRDV called in the jargon identity. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> Spijkenisse wrote literary history. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> So young and uneducated they may be. </seg>
<seg id="1565"> Finally, this is a starting point for identity. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> Szabo: &quot;Germans must play bigger role.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S. European relations, Berlin poised on a narrow diplomatic level. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> German first wave: Germany earlier this week had indicated that it would vote against the request for observer status for Palestinians at the beginning of the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1570"> But then abstained. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1572"> Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis did in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Now must be Germany due to its special relationship with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from the vote, when it came to setting up a no-fly zone. </seg>
<seg id="1577"> This was enforced by NATO. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> Germany is finding it difficult to take a clear position on important international issues? </seg>
<seg id="1579"> Yes, that is true. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> That is because it is surrounded his foreign policy away from a policy that has been managed by the United States, as it were, to a German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> To make matters worse, that Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> So the Germans find themselves trapped in the middle. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> It is expected them that they play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> I think that they their role, but they are on the way to a &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1585"> A foreign policy, as France or Britain. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> What does a &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy because specifically from a German point of view? </seg>
<seg id="1587"> It shows a willingness to take positions in on national interests, which are independent of the United States or European partners. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy, from exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1589"> Germany&apos;s economic interests are to a certain extent, unlike the other major powers and therefore needs to protect its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> These economic interests have had an impact on the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN? </seg>
<seg id="1591"> On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> We must be careful, the public, but also the elites, not to in the Arab countries. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> It definitely plays a role. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> But I would not want to give too much weight, it is not a totally one-sided relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1595"> But it certainly plays an important role in German thinking. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Germany has damaged its relations with the United States, by abstaining from the vote on important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1597"> I believe in Europe and even in the United States, there is a lot of sympathy for the German position. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic breakthrough, as in the Libyan issue. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> Perhaps even Germany will record a certain respect. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> Because it signals that it will be taken seriously as an international player and must be given to its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> In Europe there are different views on the Palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1602"> The United States have come out clearly in favour of a veto. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> There are differences between the U.S. and many European nations? </seg>
<seg id="1604"> As a result of American domestic politics have always existed. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> I believe that the government under Obama secretly quite a lot of sympathy for the European position. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> But due to the political situation, the government can not this position publicly, of course. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> I believe that the real differences are not as great as they appear. </seg>
<seg id="1608"> If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not at all talking about Netanyahu&apos;s policies. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> It is difficult to Germany&apos;s close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other side? </seg>
<seg id="1610"> I think that this is what makes it so difficult for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> It would be a little easier for the Germans, of course, if there is a coherent and unified European policy, which is not currently the case. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> So they cannot be part of a wider line and must instead push things from their own position. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> This is precisely what they do with the euro. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> I believe that Germany will take a leading role in the future to push Europe into an European position. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> This has always been a sensitive issue. </seg>
<seg id="1617"> But I believe that the Germans know that they must play a more independent role. </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Germany sees itself in the role as an important international player - Germany wants to play a major role? </seg>
<seg id="1619"> Germany is still the lead or difficult? </seg>
<seg id="1620"> Germany is still not yet been used, which is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is always hard to play a greater role in the country. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> If we look at, for example, the euro crisis, because every time Germany takes a greater role, various anti- German feelings. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> This does not make it easy for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> This is the old problem: You want to be surrounded by hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> Germany is seen in a much more difficult position than the United States. </seg>
<seg id="1625"> It must be sensitive to a variety of neighbours and opinions and that is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Now, the influence of the United States continually in European politics, the EU does not fill the vacuum at the moment but who is? </seg>
<seg id="1627"> The Germans will simply have to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Even if they do not like, it makes them uncomfortable and it is even more unpopular - c&apos;est la vie! </seg>

<seg id="1632"> Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> But what Armani Polo? </seg>
<seg id="1634"> A designation officially registered in China, which has nothing to do with the original company. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> However, as long as it enjoys protection, the actual name donors do not complain. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> And even then it is not clear whether they will get justice. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> &quot;It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,&quot; says Thomas stalemate hole, a lawyer in the law firm Taylor Wessing, which is in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> A new case every week ends up on my desk. </seg>

<seg id="1644"> The Chinese world champion in the copying and injured intellectual property, is well known. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> In the big cities, there are mehrstöckige department stores that sell almost exclusively. </seg>

<seg id="1652"> &quot;The brand will, the lone position, the image damage is enormous.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The financial losses and the cost of the affected industries are in the millions, especially in expensive flagship products. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> According to the market research company CLSA is China, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year, the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> But deletions dubious trademark registry entries are hard to reach and go into money. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> The process can drag on for up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome. </seg>

<seg id="1658"> If the plaintiff have bad luck, he would have to pay the Plagiator even money because he injured his brand in China, says stalemate hole. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> Sometimes there is the law of the jungle. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Famous cases also affect graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> 2009 Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction equipment manufacturer GGR, a company that recently took over the German concrete pump maker cleaning. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> To date, the Chinese must therefore use a logo similar to the Mercedes star. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The Volvo buyers Geely originally used a blue and white logo which recalled BMW; the dispute was resolved, Geely had to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The fashion maker Lacoste lost against counterfeiters in China from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous crocodile look in the other direction. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> The Chinese authorities are aware of no guilt. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> The Trademark Office CTMO in Beijing is that there have been 2010 due to lower personnel and equipment shortages. </seg>

<seg id="1670"> However, in the office still 81,500 appeals on completion. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> On the other hand, to address costs a lot </seg>
<seg id="1672"> As so often in China, the numbers are impressive. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Last year, when CTMO went more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> This is the tenth consecutive year, a record and that give China the list of applications around the world, shares the authority. </seg>

<seg id="1677"> Put simply, this means that each application costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> The fight against costs several times, as in the case of the German family company Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> For more than seven years, the company is fighting against a Chinese Plagiator. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> While the Germans have been able to do that was dug its illegal manufacturing imitation of motor vehicle parts. </seg>

<seg id="1685"> We must use extreme caution </seg>
<seg id="1686"> The matter is now before the Supreme Court of Justice. </seg>
<seg id="1687"> Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> But he also says: &quot;The process is extremely complex and is costing us a lot of time, money and nervous.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1689"> The internal cost could be difficult to quantify, the company&apos;s archive had to look arcives even one hundred years old files to provide evidence. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> Five years ago, a &quot;high six-figure euro amount&quot; in Freudenberg the other side to settlement. </seg>

<seg id="1692"> The dangers in the Far East zurückzuschwappen even threaten to Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> Then, if there territory.What Doubles vulnerable brands. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> As a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> This business has long since abandoned the group, but he could avert the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> &quot;We must use extreme caution,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Both he and the lawyer stalemate hole advising German companies to be very careful in dealings with China. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> It is not enough to rely on international brands, but the foreigners &quot;everything is somehow worth protecting, but also in China,&quot; says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Otherwise, much more expensive than the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> In fact, if Freudenberg last act of his trademark drama, then you would have to pay the other side licence fees for their own name, said Wentzler. </seg>

<seg id="1731"> In a joint Africa trip in the spring of 2005 the choir discovered the village, but above all, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, which not only lack of parental responsibility, but simply of of everything: food, clothing, education. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> Without a school in a poor country certainly no chance. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> Initially, it was still a private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros per year and make him a hot meal a day. </seg>

<seg id="1743"> In the case of heterosexual adults are chlamydia infections, success (mushroom), Tripper and Humane Pappilomaviren common sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is comparatively small - yet: 20 percent of HIV infections in this group. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> Chlamydia infections among young people are much more frequent than other groups. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> According to European surveys three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25. </seg>

<seg id="1771"> A king with 14 wives </seg>
<seg id="1772"> &quot;AIDS is an absolute taboo,&quot; says Annette Lennartz, &quot;because it has to do with sexuality.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1773"> Strange in a country where the king officially 14 wives. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> The last absolute monarch in sub-Saharan Africa, King Mswati III is known for his excessive lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Polygamy rather than democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> Among other things, it is due to officially sanctioned way of life that has spread of the in recent decades. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus around the country. </seg>
<seg id="1778"> Free condoms every corner, Annette Lennartz says, &quot;but the rarely used. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> The culture is different - Flesh to Flesh. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1780"> In order to promote the cultural exchange something, the Imbongi choir every two or three years, together with the South Africa and sings songs full of, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence that many on the southern tip of the black continent still of apartheid. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> A bus full of white, singing the songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but also has minor some fierce border guards a few tears. </seg>

<seg id="1820"> The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (divided into three sections, dreigespalten), dreiteilen as dark dust, the fiery heart of the star&apos;s birthplace. </seg>
<seg id="1821"> In our own galaxy, astronomers have photographed harbingers of a cosmic Karambolage: 400 million light years from Earth hurtling the cores of two verschmelzender galaxies collide and will inevitably collide with each other. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> These stars are born of the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83. </seg>

<seg id="1824"> The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows a portion of the Iris Nebula in the star image Kepheus. </seg>
<seg id="1825"> The 1400 light years distant fog consists of dust grains, the ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary household dust. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> This image was assembled from optical and X-ray images of different telescopes. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light-years from Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> This group of galaxies called Arp 273, the space telescope Hubble for Nasa. </seg>

<seg id="1835"> Our insights into space: The most important telescopes </seg>
<seg id="1836"> The telescope will have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperfeld Hey - even before it began a year later to the stars Galileo Galilei observation. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> Since then, the mirror of optical telescopes ever greater, and the insights they provide, deeper and deeper. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, was the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego, the largest telescope in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> The mirror, in this image, had an average of five metres. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> In Arizona, USA, is the Large Binocular Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> You can gaze into space on two levels, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> The inner workings of the Gran Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma Telescopio is huge - the mirror is at 10.4 meters in diameter. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope is segmented in South Africa - in order to save costs. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of eleven metres. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> As part of the design: the telescope is in his elevation angle - and thus limited in his mobility. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> The hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is fixed in the elevation angle. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> Its special feature: the high Lichtsammelkraft. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> This is - despite comparatively low mirror diameter - the world&apos;s largest mirror telescopes. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers told the space for alien signals. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1851"> In the &quot;Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) every computer owner can help by putting computing power. </seg>
<seg id="1852"> Look at the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in Chile&apos;s Andes. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> Here is the Very Large Telescope - makes his name. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> With its four mirrors in the telescope can also the infrared spectrum. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> Also on the Chilean ESO Observatory is the planned European Extremely Large Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> Its main mirror is to include 42 meters - and nearly 1000 mirrors elements. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> But with images can be expected until 2018. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> By 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea as the largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> They offer two mirrors, each with an average of ten metres. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which provides them with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF in the sky. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> Also on the summit of Mauna Kea is to create a new, huge telescope with a mirror average of thirty metres. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> It is here on an illustration. </seg>
<seg id="1863"> But the main impressions from space provides the space telescope Hubble. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> Since the April 24, 1990, already provides images of distant worlds. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope for extrasolar planets - especially for those that are habitable. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> On February 2, 2011, was commissioned by the Nasa announced that identified 1235 planet candidates since the beginning of the mission. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> In the picture are documented the final launch preparations at the space telescope Kepler. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be taken until at least 2018 on board an Ariane5 spacecraft. </seg>
<seg id="1869"> The primary mirror of Weltrauminfrarotteleskops has a diameter of 6.5 meters. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> One of the tasks of the telescope: it is to look for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> Scientists estimate that the Mercury also at the South Pole ice. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> However, there are no reliable data, since the Messenger far closer to the North Pole to the planet. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> Radar measurements for decades have pointed out that there are on the ice. </seg>

<seg id="1884"> Everything is green and juicy, you might think that you are in the Black Forest. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> The Caucasian ethnic group of the Talyschen lives, which is not much known, except that it perfectly Farsi and Azeri speaks and is very durable. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> &quot;Is Lerik. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> The small town of flaunts to stoke runaway architecture from Soviet times, which does not fit in the picturesque mountain landscape. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> Hardly any tourists from Europe come here, too onerous, is the arrival of Azerbaijan&apos;s capital Baku. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> For the 323 kilometres you need eight hours, because the road is. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> The fabulous wealth of the country&apos;s oil in the Caspian Sea, is not here in the province. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the tourist attraction. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> &quot;Baku was in May with the Eurovision Song festival - and next year we have here is a festival of the oldest people in the world,&quot; says Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> She is the director of the Museum of longevity, the only one in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> Here is the similar.This documented by about eight dozen Talyschen from the area, who are older than 100. Fatulayeva shows a black-and-white photo. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> In the age of 136 years of a child </seg>
<seg id="1898"> But controversial star of the museum is the shepherd irali Müslümov, which will be 168 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> But it is not a birth certificate. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> And given the oldest documented person who was 122 years old, Müslümovs age but extremely doubtful. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> &quot;In 1805, he was born here in the region, he died in 1973,&quot; said Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1902"> The man was married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136, he is said to have a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> It right irali Müslümov at his age by a few decades? </seg>
<seg id="1904"> But also Rembrandt Scholz, age, researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of the elderly in Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> &quot;There is also a many hochaltrige people striking how in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,&quot; says Scholz, &quot;live in Sardinia of very old men.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1906"> Due to the lack of documentation is to have no scientific proof of age, especially civil register. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> Every day becherweise melted butter </seg>
<seg id="1908"> But the fact is that the people of the region around Lerik often striking a biblisches age. </seg>
<seg id="1909"> There are currently 20 people who are older than 100 years. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> So why live here in the south so many Hochbetagte? </seg>
<seg id="1911"> The Azeri tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh declared with the specific genes of Talyschen. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> Museum director Fatulayeva believes, however, that it is a matter of the diet. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> But that should be the high-calorie diet of Talyschen as healthy, meat, bread and milk products, in particular, love and many daily drink a glass of melted butter, not just from a nutritional point of view seems plausible. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the city Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> With 97 years for this, it is still relatively young. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, typical of the entire Caucasus region. </seg>

<seg id="1922"> I washed my hair with milk, so they never went out and retained their colour. </seg>
<seg id="1923"> &quot;I have never used,&quot; says Mirzayeva shampoo. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> Monthly pension is enough life </seg>
<seg id="1925"> She has always eaten only what came from their own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> All my life I have not bought a single time in supermarket food. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> Then she told of her husband, who was in the army. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> It was the worst in the of the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> But everything was better than the &quot;beloved father&quot; Heydar Aliyew took the helm. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> But the cult, is driven by the nation&apos;s father figure, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows no limits in Azerbaijan. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> Until 2003 he was in power, and later his son Ilham took over the helm. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> After all, there is no need for the elderly. </seg>
<seg id="1934"> 230 Manat (about the same amount in euros), Mirzayeva per month as a pension, for conditions, it is possible to live well. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> And perhaps has long since Mirzayevas Bacardi son right: &quot;The old people enjoy in our culture.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1936"> They live in the midst of the extended family, loved, cared for and are happy. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> If this is not a reason, as long as possible to stay alive </seg>

<seg id="1944"> &quot;And that he will succeed, is my responsibility to the people and before God,&quot; he said on state television. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> His speech was addressed to all the people, but above all, the Christian Copts, the Liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> Because all of them, has been hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, fear. </seg>
<seg id="1947"> Fear of theocracy in the Nile by grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> He has said almost entschuldigend Mohamed Morsi, the powers of the Constitutional Court temporarily and expanded its competences, &quot;to save the revolution.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1949"> But what the 61-year-old engineer who holds a PhD from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians, the world is not quite clear. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> The judiciary should be ousted? </seg>
<seg id="1951"> Indeed, the 234 articles, the 100 -member Constituent Assembly dominated by the Islamist in a night, were pushed through 15 -hour two-volume set, worrying. </seg>
<seg id="1952"> As in past constitutions, the draft, the case law based on the &quot;principles of Islamic law.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1953"> But what is called &quot;principles&quot;? </seg>
<seg id="1954"> This was and is open to interpretation, and it is feared that Islamists will use the vague wording and the attendant legal room for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> This suggests at least a new hinzugeführter Article: in all matters concerning the Sharia influences must be considered university, the country&apos;s main Islamic institution with great power throughout the of the Sunni Islam. </seg>
<seg id="1956"> This must not, but it may mean that oversees the clergy the legislation, which would de facto disenfranchisement of the judiciary. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> Many in the Verfassunsgsentwurf is open to interpretation </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Also problematic: The civilian military jurisdiction should be maintained. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> These dishes served during Mubarak&apos;s rule to the repression of political opponents. </seg>

<seg id="1965"> For another, prohibits the Prophet Mohammed and his envoys to offend or slander. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> But what an insult is and how it should be punished, remains unclear. </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Just as questionable is the phrase that &quot;insulting people&quot; should be banned. </seg>
<seg id="1968"> There is already a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a Leader? </seg>

<seg id="2002"> Norway&apos;s five million inhabitants enjoy the highest living standards - and not just in Europe but around the world. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> The secret of the success of the country have to do something with the local appetite for pretty nasty smelling fish? </seg>
<seg id="2004"> Take a selection of overripe cheese varieties. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> It platziere them a pile of dirty, humid sports clothing. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> And leave it there for a week. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> So the nasenbetäubenden smell of Rakfisk, one of the great delights of Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> I find myself in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> There is snow, spectacular landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air, which just won&apos;t go away. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> Rakfisk is with salt bestreute trout, which, depending on how you would have stinky fish - in water up to a year. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> The darkness over the land, and the weather is colder in Norway, Norwegian at a festival in Fagernes, now, that this is really very eye-catching speciality. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> &quot;You eat it raw and washed it down with a glass of aquavit,&quot; says Harvard Halvarsen, who works in the local fire station, but as a so-called &quot;Rakfisk General&quot; organized the festival. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> Around us, people eat small fish cubes and take on large quantities of alcohol. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> &quot;Mansche people like the aquavit more than the Rakfisk,&quot; says Harvard. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> The spirit can crowd out the smell. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> I eat some. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> Avoiding the Rakfisk in, he is not bad - like sushi, which has quite a long bus ride. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there was no cooling opportunities and was soaked fish in the autumn in airtight salt water barrels. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> In the deepest winter, he was removed after a long fermentation and - no doubt with the help of theRule subdued - consumed alcohol. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> Even a generation ago had thousands of Norwegians in search of work, to leave their country and mainly in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> Today the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a booming job market, high wages and a comprehensive health care. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> Even from Sweden, the old rivals, not so long ago was far richer than Norway, are immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> Rakfisk is seen as something important - as an essential, albeit strictly smelling part of the Norwegian history. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> He is one of the more expensive meals, which can be bought here. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> But everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs $10. </seg>
<seg id="2026"> Norway does not often in the world press, and most people do not seem to interfere with that. </seg>
<seg id="2027"> Still, to name Anders Breivik hates it here - those racist right-wing extremists, who last year 77 men, women and children shot. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> Instead, it referred only to the &quot;incident on 22 July.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2029"> Norwegians find it difficult to accept that someone is in its peace-loving country to such brutal killings. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> The main responsibility for today&apos;s wealth of Norway is one of the largest oil and Gasindustrien since the early 1970 s, the growth of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> &quot;But oil is not the only reason why we are so good,&quot; says Anna, our waitress, the round trays with enthuse Rakfisk and with her long blond hair and piercing blue eyes the Nordic ideal. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> We are a - as they say - sensible people. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> Her English is just like that of most people here. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> We are not, we may not redeem your boasting. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> Norway has been very cautious with its oil wealth - a large proportion of the industry proceeds will be invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> As in the years leading up to the world economic crisis all money around, they had not hielt Norway. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> &quot;As long as we can go skiing in winter and hiking in the summer, we are happy,&quot; says Anna. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> &quot;And, of course, Rakfisk,&quot; it deals with easy laughter. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> I am standing in the snow and another court - from Rakfisk I have enough. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> So a moose burgers is something else. The juicy meat goes down me. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> But on the evening of Stinkefisch is back on the menu. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> The hotel, where I logiere, is one of several locations that organise a Rakfisk dinner where guests for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - can vote fish smell sense of. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> There is a live TV circuit with a fly at show, which is surrounded by plates with Rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2044"> The spectacle resembles the Eurovision Song Contest. </seg>
<seg id="2045"> &quot;What score you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor Jürgen?&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2046"> &quot;Here are our points to Harvard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2047"> We applauded laughs. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> A man falls from his, perhaps overwhelmed by the aquavit. </seg>
<seg id="2049"> But perhaps it is the strict haze of the whole fish. </seg>

<seg id="2051"> While preparing Mexico&apos;s President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto on his arrival, the BBC&apos;s Will Grant of the challenges ahead of it and the mixed feelings of its people. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> The traffic is particularly bad in Mexico City. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> Even in better days, this is always a congested city, but on Monday a ring of steel, several important transport routes in the capital and has sealed off the streets for chaos. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> The aim was not to disrupt commuters on their way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> On Saturday, Mexico&apos;s new president Enrique Pena Nieto as president, and take over the leadership of the nation. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> He faces a complex task. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> Under the outgoing government of President Felipe Calderon&apos;s Mexico has to prove itself economically, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has cost 60,000 lives in the past six years. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> &quot;My government is strongly committed to reduce the violence,&quot; Pena Nieto said earlier this week in the Oval Office U.S. President Barack Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> I will propose a new security strategy, we can achieve this goal. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> Before he went to the U.S. president on an equal footing, Pena Nieto was governor of his home state of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> In this densely populated, large part of the country, which surrounds the capital, opinions are divided on the new head of state. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> A direct man </seg>
<seg id="2063"> In the remote town of Valle del Bravo remembered fondly, for example,. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Residents of the resort to write to the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> In order to reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto built and a great improvement on the fragile, bumpy roads that were here. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> With his name attached outside of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> &quot;We expect real and lasting change,&quot; says his friend and political ally Gabriel Hernandez, who as a congressman for the party Pena Nietos, the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> In particular, with regard to the security and economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced in 2000 by Vicente Fox. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> The Congressman incredible admits that the party after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> The accusations from the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> He was a very direct guy, very committed and have big plans for the country. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> He was a great statesman, but above all, he is someone who can listen to. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> But on the other side of the state, many people do not share this view of their former governor. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> The place is hidden under Autobahnüber tours and, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> And the problems in the community are of vital urban nature. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> Earlier this year, the military was called in to fight the drug gangs operating in the districts, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> On an of wasteland near a large landfill sites were left behind in the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murders of women. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> During the term of governor Pena Nieto were murdered in the State of Mexico about 1,000 women - a statistic that surpasses even that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which for their violence and the killing of innocent women. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> The critics Pena Nietos are of the opinion that he is not tackled the problem of the murders of women during his tenure at least adequately. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> But in the worst case of his government have closed their eyes to the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> In a concrete building, typical of the run-down district, fighting Irinea Buendia with tears, as she shows me photographs of their deceased daughter Mariana Luna. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> According to the official version of events, Mariana 2010 committed suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> &quot;When I arrived at her door, it seemed as if the body had been washed,&quot; recalls Senora Buendia). </seg>
<seg id="2087"> There were signs that she was beaten, and the bodies discipline had already used. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> While her mother tells her story, from the wall a picture of Mariana on us. It is right next to a cross, which is a single word: justice. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> But it is precisely this, so the family, have denied it. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> The authorities have treated me as if I were a Schwätzerin troubler, Nörglerin. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> They simply want to, that we accept their verdict and. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> &quot;But that is not possible when there were so many errors and omissions,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> If welcomes President Pena Nieto, the President body-peeling on Saturday, he is also a great responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been drawn in the last six years of violent crime, and the new president has promised to take care of this problem, particularly during his tenure at. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> &quot;I hope that as president he is, as he was as governor,&quot; said PRI Congressman incredible in Valle del Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> But that is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most. </seg>

<seg id="2108"> In the hearing on Friday was fine with Manning, the forms were filled out by the officials after their meeting with Manning during his detention in a military prison, where he had spent from July 2010 to April 2011 under enhanced conditions of detention. </seg>

<seg id="2110"> When asked him on Friday to the forms, Manning that he has the treatment by his guards as &quot;excellent&quot; and the treatment by the establishment as a whole was as &quot;very professional.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2111"> The forms, so fine, had no complaints about mistreatment, although officials had questioned Manning directly on his treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> Manning said that he had expressed his concerns orally and the officials had discussed this with him and to deal with this, but they have been recorded. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> &quot;They wrote (after meeting the concerns of&quot; no problems ,&quot; and this did not necessarily mean that I said nothing at all,&quot; says Manning. </seg>

<seg id="2116"> The military said that it had this restrictive status - is the one step below the suicide threat - assigned to his and the protection of others. </seg>

<seg id="2123"> When he was transferred to, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society. </seg>
<seg id="2124"> He had only a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> Manning said he tried to stay on the move, because it is a day had been forbidden to sleep or lie down. </seg>

<seg id="2135"> That night, Manning said, his underwear, has been removed Flip flops and glasses from his cell. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> His lawyers hope that the judge at least take into account of his experiences in prison and will drastically reduce its prison standards, he should be sentenced at his trial before the military court, which is scheduled for early next year. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> The defence has indicated that Manning guilty of minor offences, while other charges that are considered too extreme to be challenged. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend. The prosecutor is expected to justify the detention conditions. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning was detained in accordance with the provisions for all under the highest security precautions in the custody of prisoners. </seg>

<seg id="2142"> My Mexican American identity crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2143"> Due to the lack of opportunities, many people were forced to leave Mexico </seg>
<seg id="2144"> Mexicans tend to blame the emigrants - they call them hard times, he says </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Navarre popotte believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds </seg>
<seg id="2146"> On a recent trip to Mexico City I had just crossed the hall and was arrived at the passport control, wide. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Signs pointed to two queues, one for &quot;Mexican Wochos&quot; (&quot;Mexicans&quot;), another for &quot;Number&quot; (&quot;foreigners&quot;). </seg>
<seg id="2148"> I stood there for a few seconds, to which I should go. </seg>
<seg id="2149"> I grew up in Central California and has been all my life, &quot;Mexicans.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2150"> An ethnic symbol - just am friends in Boston &quot;Irish&quot; or &quot;Italians&quot; call my friends in New York. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> Later, I opted for &quot;Mexican&quot; / .&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2152"> But this was Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> And in my grandfather&apos;s home, there was no need for shortcuts or binding. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> I was just Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> I speak Spanish, at least good enough to say in this language at both ends of an interview. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> But I do not have the vocabulary of a Muttersprachlers, and my American accent, I will not go. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for registration. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> I thought about that moment this week, as did the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, the White House to meet with President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> On the agenda were all those issues which are expected to meet the heads of the two countries: immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> Pena Nieto was also very keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason that Mexicans remain today, with a high degree of probability in Mexico, rather than emigrate to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> He wants to ally itself with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc after the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> Mexico&apos;s Pena Nieto vowed to continue the war against the drug cartels, although he gave no details. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> Mexico&apos;s relationship with the United States is complex and full of resentment. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> Most Americans probably never waste a single idea that the United States invaded in 1848 in Mexico and forced the country&apos;s leadership under vorgehaltenem gun to leave them more than half of its territory. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> But for Mexicans who think in centuries rather than in minutes, the memories of this event. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> So once, an U.S. government official mildest criticism of Mexico, one hears - in the Mexican press and among the elites, the country&apos;s - complaints about how the Americans the sovereignty of their neighbour&apos;s. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> And the Monte Zuma&apos;s children on the. </seg>
<seg id="2168"> And yet, in truth, is the biggest challenge in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Want to talk about? </seg>
<seg id="2170"> There are more than enough. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others, for which it does not. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at a point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or grandparent - offered no chance in Mexico, and in the north. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> And in most cases, this person was a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is to them. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> In Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> And while we may be living the American dream, good schools and received good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Our identity is blurred at times, but as far as our loyalty, this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> This is certainly the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> In addition, we are aware that we do not like many members of the Mexican ruling class. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> This is based on reciprocity. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> They see us as a monument to a humiliating defeat and looking down on us, because we are not Mexican enough. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico never strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> They believe our existence is a symbol of failure. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> If not failed our families in Mexico, they would have. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> And then we would not be caught behind the silk curtain now see - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and einwanderte legally as a child in the United States, I am reminded that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans blame them. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> While it is an U.S. citizen, as part of two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> But many Mexican Americans who I know have the feeling of, neither one nor the other country. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> It enjoys the best of both worlds, but is rooted in none of them. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> In Mexico, we are seen as Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> And we are seen as Mexicans in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes it even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the education and want to record their links to the diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> They want to Mexican Americans as provisional &quot;ambassador&quot; for Mexico, which represent their interests in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> We should tell our American colleagues, how great a visit to this country and put pressure on political leaders to intensify their ties to Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Now. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> This will not happen. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> Too many wounded feelings. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> And given the unjust distribution of income, rampant corruption and the drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> I am afraid, because you alone,. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> This is fair. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a year and a half centuries, they also have to accept that some Mexican Americans have a, for what happened to their family members so long ago. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Hmmm). </seg>
<seg id="2204"> Perhaps we are &quot;Mexican&quot; than I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2205"> Old battles, new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2206"> The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected cornerstone for peace </seg>
<seg id="2207"> There can be any lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2208"> The latest bloody events seem to stifle such hope in the bud. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> Amid the usual recriminations countless buildings in ruins, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, were killed and six Israelis - and, for the first time rockets from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> But while Israelis and Palestinians seem caught in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed. </seg>
<seg id="2213"> But there are reasons to believe that could find the deadly standoff finally end. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> A war that neither will be won or lost </seg>
<seg id="2215"> At first glance seems appropriate given the current situation is optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November, have strengthened the this week&apos;s fighting hardcore on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim that the Israelis, although his group even suffered heavy losses. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Although several Hamas leaders killed and packed the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip in one of the desolatesten and densely bevölkertesten corners of the planet, Israel has failed so far to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> Indeed, Hamas wins in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> And Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that they have time on their side. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> As Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has to hold powerful and wealthy friends on their side. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Turkey, a wiedererstarkende, regional power, which was once known as well as Israel&apos;s closest Muslim ally, has taken on Hamas - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> Cheering Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamic crescent - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah power over Syria, where rebels could be an increasingly islamistischeren character before the Stürzung Bashar Assad, to to Jordan, where Hamas is threatening allies of the king. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> And, in particular the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under President Muhammad Morsi - by far the most densely populated and most important Arab country, on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 2011 30 years until his overthrow, had little time for Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> By contrast, the Brotherhood is out with Hamas and its leaders more popular views. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In future diplomatic negotiations could prove Hamas as a player that can&apos;t be squeezed out of Israel and the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> Israeli hardliners, however, to draw the opposite conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> Military terms, however, that Hamas is no longer a threat. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> The Israeli missile defense system, &quot;Iron Dome,&quot; has been able to prove itself and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> At least for a while Israel will be able to sleep peacefully. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> In diplomatic terms, the United States has been steadfast in their position. Many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest escalation of violence. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Israel has fared well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the industry, which hineinverlaufen in the West Bank and in the main part of an eventual Palestinian state, which protect the Jewish settlements that have been declared for international law, however, be. </seg>
<seg id="2235"> Netanyahu is doing well. His Likud Party has allied itself in the run-up to the elections on 22 January under Avigdor Lieberman with an even kämpferischeren group. </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Why is this cunning Palestinians cuddled and handed them their own state? </seg>
<seg id="2237"> If they had, the control of the West Bank, just like their in Gaza, then it would not fire rockets? </seg>
<seg id="2238"> No, it is better to keep them behind the wall in check and to punish, should they dare to raise their heads. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> It may be able to the hardliners. But the Arab Spring could make them. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Even if the Islamists, who are now in power in Egypt and other countries, have little left for Israel, they will focus initially on the difficulties in their own country. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> Israel&apos;s defense budget is larger than that of his four Arab neighbours. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to its economy. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> The pragmatic President Morsi teamed up with Barack Obama, in order to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new era. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> Israelis should think long-term. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg, which is undoubtedly will explode one day in the Israeli occupied territories, exploded as a bus in Tel Aviv this week. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population will only worsen the situation. </seg>
<seg id="2247"> Bloody missions for the eradication of Hamas in the Gaza Strip will demand over the years increasing its diplomatic toll. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> Both sides need a push from outside </seg>
<seg id="2249"> The answer is that the the more reasonable members of both parties, which most of the rest of the world and by this newspaper: two states, which Israel is stepping down for security purposes. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> The - in the near future small - hope is that the cease-fire outsiders more influence on the implementation of this solution. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> Together with Turkey and Qatar, Egypt must now stop the flow of arms into the Gaza Strip and Hamas is better positioned than ever to the idea of a Jewish state on the basis of 1967 borders, with land swaps, and a shared Jerusalem, to convince. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Outsiders Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state, with the forthcoming request for U.N. observer status. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Obama must do its part to persuade Israel to negotiate. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> During his first term he missed the idea of his own peace plan. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> Far away in the White House, it seems as if he were also participating. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> But this is a sad, short-sighted perspective. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="2259"> And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>

<seg id="2266"> It is the government of studies that have shown that people who have not started to smoke will not start with 26, with 99% probability accordingly. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> &quot;You can see in children younger age that they understand the message that the tobacco companies trying to compete with their brand image,&quot; federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. They cited studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown logo with the idea of an of a princess. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Although Australia is one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will affect only slightly on the profits of the multinationals, other countries are considering similar steps. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> The tobacco lobby fought hard against the law. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> It was said that the laws would encourage the black market trade, which lead to cheaper and more readily accessible cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> &quot;The law will lead to serious, unintended consequences,&quot; says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Others say that the laws have boosted their business. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> Sandra Ha of best like Zico import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that the demand for increased and silicone without for the companies to cover the unbearable packaging, British American Tobacco, Britain&apos;s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed two months ago at the Australian Supreme Court with its challenge to the law. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> Zico have up to 6,000 units sold to wholesalers and look for new stocks. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> For us, this is a good business. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> According to experts, the hooks in the popularity of social media in the group, which is the plan. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> A number of Australian laws has banned tobacco companies from the TV advertising, they are not allowed to act as sports sponsors and forced most traders to interpret cigarettes in shops longer. Now is the tobacco advertising on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sides. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> &quot;Who sells tobacco and has only a small area, in order to promote its products, not the Internet,&quot; says Becky Freeman, a researcher in health care at the University of Sydney. </seg>
<seg id="2281"> On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook Freeman has noted an increase in reports to brands, the of &quot;ordinary people&quot; have been written. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> The question must be asked: Is this just a private person who Is so enjoyed Marlboro cigarettes that they even include a video - or a marketing agency has to do with it? </seg>
<seg id="2283"> British American Tobacco Australia, says that the industry will concentrate instead on marketing to deal with the new laws. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> It has even gone so far to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic in the World trade Organisation to challenge the new rules - those countries complain about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries pursuing greater trade in Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> The government has held talks with other countries, according to plibersek considering similar packaging laws. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Canada 2001 was the first country, made the photographic warnings. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> They have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> Tougher laws are considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> Many Australian smokers defiantly show. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> The images do not affect me. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> I simply ignore them. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> &quot;It is simply an and the box away,&quot; says Victor El Hage when buying a packet of cigarettes on which is printed a photo with a mouth tumour. </seg>
<seg id="2294"> Frankly, there is only one reason why I would stop, and this is my little girl. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade &quot;King of the Pack&quot; in downtown Sydney, says that the packaging have hampered his shelves. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> &quot;I took a hour to classify a delivery, now I need four,&quot; says Yu. </seg>
<seg id="2297"> &quot;The government should have simply prohibit cigarettes altogether - then we would have said OK, that&apos;s it, we close,&quot; he adds visibly angry. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> In an ever elektrisierten world, it is nice to be bored </seg>
<seg id="2299"> This Thanksgiving unexpectedly I spent five hours in the airport, as our plane due to mechanical problems, and we had to wait for another plane. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> I had enough time to make a few thoughts on boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2301"> I am not going to. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> A waiting half a day at the airport on a flight that is pretty annoying - even when books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, steuerfreies shopping) are available. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> But a growing number of academics and child development experts boredom as something positive. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> So far as they are concerned, it is for us - and our children - okay, sometimes to be bored. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> So that the brain is forced to get caught up in interesting thoughts, which promotes the creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2306"> And since rigid nowadays most of us almost constantly on the one or other screen, the benefits of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> We should welcome the boredom with open arms? </seg>
<seg id="2308"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> And no. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> I will come back again. </seg>
<seg id="2311"> Like many people, I am always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of &quot;Bore Cathedral: A Lively history&quot; (Yale University Press, 2011) is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> &quot;Indeed, the boredom of a very long history,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> The house walls Pompejis adorns a Latin graffiti about boredom, going back to the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> And then there is the question of how we define boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2316"> John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that in many ways been defined and discussed is boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> Professor Eastwood and his colleagues after a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea of a focus group of about 100 people came to the conclusion that boredom than the experience, &quot;to be able to do a satisfactory job, but it is not define.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2318"> Boredom differs from apathy, therefore, in such a way that is not the person, but I want to be. </seg>
<seg id="2319"> In the apathy, on the other hand, there is no urge to do something. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> The key experience of boredom, he says, is in a &quot;the process, coupled with a bad temper and the feeling that time passes slowly.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Boredom can almost hear as depression. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> But Professor Eastwood believes, although they could be two things, bored people see the problem in their area or in the world, while depressive people see the problem in itself. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Sometimes we believe that we are boring, even if we have just difficult to concentrate. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> In their study, &quot;the Unengaged mind: Defi Ning Bore Cathedral in terms of attention&quot; - to: &quot;the idle mind: the definition of boredom in terms of attention,&quot; which in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science &quot;was, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues on an earlier experiment, the participants listened to a tape in which a person read a magazine article. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> Some groups have heard a loud television programme from the neighbouring area, which had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so that it was barely perceptible, while the third group not heard these sounds at all. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> The people who heard the barely audible television, said to have more boredom than the other two groups - they had problems to focus, could find no reason for it and wrote their difficulties of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2327"> If you try to focus on a difficult and arduous task, the disruption of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neurosciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> If you put a monotonous work, &quot;as the search for defective products on a factory conveyor belt, can distract music and help to not feel bored.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2329"> Indeed, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, may even combat this by physical persons remain attentive. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> &quot;Studies have shown that children who must learn herumhampeln, more and more information than those who are forced to remain seated,&quot; says Professor Fenske. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> All of us will ever be boring - my delayed flight, a dröhnender loudspeakers, a particularly tedious film. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> But some people bored more easily than others. </seg>
<seg id="2333"> To measure these differences, researchers have developed in the 1980 s on a &quot;scale of boredom vulnerability.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2334"> On the scale found statements such as &quot;there are a lot of things that I have to do, and monotonous&quot; and &quot;I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2335"> Researchers have found that boys with of such abradability more boring than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially, with regard to the need for more and greater diversity of external stimuli. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> But in general, teenagers are a pretty abgespannter clusters. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> He found that 32% of adolescents in school and doing the homework bored, while 23% said to be bored if they were not in school. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> But only 3% of parents said to feel bored. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> Today, 21 years later, Professor Larson says he does not know whether the percentages have risen or fallen in terms of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2341"> But he was sure that &quot;youth is seen as a particularly boring,&quot; mainly because children and teenagers have no major impact on their daily routines. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> So back to my original question: is boredom healthy? </seg>
<seg id="2343"> Sometimes, as in the extreme case, it leads people to extreme physical risks and addicted to gambling or drugs to alleviate it, studies have shown. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is a professor Vodanovich, who researched the subject for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> &quot;With the boredom of the brain to say that we should do something else,&quot; says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But the brain does not always know what to do it best. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> If a boring and energy to play guitar and to cook, you will be happy. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> But television can provide for happiness in the short term, but these evaporate in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> So who is his bored child an iPad, it can distract from the boredom, but it has not learned to entertain themselves or to control, says Professor Fenske.. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> And he adds: &quot;self-regulation is transferred from one situation to another.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Not only the child learns to talk, but also in other areas more self-control. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> I do not believe that we should celebrate. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> We should do not see it too critical. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> Instead, our objective should be to feel at of permanent Aktivitäts and technology. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> Professor Eastwood agrees. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> &quot;It sounds so we should be more boring. But boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2357"> He believes that people are looking for a way to switch off and relax in truth only. </seg>
<seg id="2358"> &quot;In an environment in which we are constantly überstimuliert, it is hard to address, if the noise.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2359"> In Colorado, there are no clear guidelines for the new marijuana law </seg>
<seg id="2360"> The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is in southeast Colorado for a crime to justice, which will be in this country legally soon: the possession of a few of marijuana and a pipe, with which he smoked it. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> The said that he and some friends were on a September day by car in Lamar near the border with Kansas, when they were stopped. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> After the police officers found marijuana in the car, Orozco was cited for possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia - excusable peccadilloes that are equipped with a penalty of $100 - and has a court date. </seg>
<seg id="2363"> &quot;We are treated like criminals,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> But he is also a? </seg>
<seg id="2365"> In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer depends on hundreds of minor drug offenses, less by the law, as the location. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> Hundreds of the offences that revolve around marijuana, here and in the State of Washington, already approved similar measures, dropped. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> The police authorities are adults over 21 years longer for possession on a small scale. This is allowed by law, once the new laws come into force in the next few weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> But prosecutors in the more conservative districts Colorados have announced that existing marijuana offenses, and people are still quoting in court. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> At the same time voting in several cities, from the suburbs Denvers to the Western Mountains on new to prevent state licensed marijuana shops in the opening in their communities. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> &quot;This situation is evolving so rapidly that I do not know what will happen next,&quot; says Daniel J. resigned, police chief in Aurora, located east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> And regulators in Washington State loss scratch on the head. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> They are waiting for guidance on setting up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline of 1 December 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> In Washington, the conventional wisdom is that in any case, most states Colorado, with regard to the regulation of marijuana was only legalized the drug for medical purposes and then for private consumption. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> &quot;Colorado has a more regulated market. The state lends itself so well to,&quot; says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the for spirits in the state of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> But Smith is also that no place or system can do more than serve as a rough guide. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> &quot;We have no real precedent that we can follow,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> The Washington law, known as I- 502, enters into force on 6 December and at the end of a grey area in which the state licensing system does not exist yet, but it is legalized the possession. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> And unpleasant practice questions need to be addressed in this time around, as the government&apos;s target of a &quot;fair access&quot; to lizenziertem marijuana beeps with the prohibition of cannabis shops within 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds should be agreed and childcare facilities. </seg>
<seg id="2379"> &quot;It will be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area,&quot; says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the &quot;Center for Legal cannabis,&quot; a recently formed research group. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> On 21 November, sent his staff in Aurora Chief resigned in an e-mail in which he said that the prosecutor would not pursue minor marijuana offenses in people over 21 years, and that the police &quot;will not seek prosecutions for such offences. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> The police chief resigned added that will continue to enforce the rules regulating growers of medical marijuana and urban targets would continue to pursue drug traffickers. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> In Weld County in northern Colorado County prosecutor Ken Buck represents a harsher view. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> After the vote, he admitted that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to encourage consumers to withdrawal. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> To date, 119 people have been charged for possession of 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, although many have been charged for other offenses. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> &quot;Our authority has a duty to prosecute offences, to the point of the,&quot; Buck said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The reactions are themselves in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, ambivalent. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, does not adults for the possession of small quantities for longer. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> District prosecutor Pete Hautz Reißinger supported this decision, but decided not to drop all outstanding possession proceedings. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> &quot;I do not think I&apos;m wasting my time trying to enforce the law until it is changing,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> Although 55% of voters supported the measure in Colorado, was clear from the outset that it would not be easy, the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> Among local officials, and the contradictory reactions throughout the state encouraged a profound dilemma in terms of the big green experiment. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> In county prosecutors if it were a &quot;cultural barrier,&quot; said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, for marijuana offenses the in court, and local acts as a spokesman for the National Organization for the reform of marijuana laws. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> &quot;They have spent such a large part of their lives in order to prosecute people for it, that they cannot accept the legalization still,&quot; he believes. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> As the first states to deal with the small quantities of marijuana like alcohol, traded Colorado and Washington as a national model for the legalization of drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> While advocates and state officials an era of legal sales, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which wants to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level as a criminal offence. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> For the legalization movement hope that will give the Ministry of Justice. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Despite several striking arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government has the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states large part. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy advisor to the Obama administration believes that no doors are likely to law enforcement officials to seize smaller quantities of drugs, but probably will resist, under the new legislation to allow legal, state-regulated marijuana shops. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Several cities in Colorado not wait to see the federal authorities. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> Even before the election day, some local administrations moratoriums on new marijuana shops, although it could open in about a year. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, a six-month ban, which probably will be adopted next week. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> &quot;We would not be to get someone in a position where we license and then at the federal level are facing a major problem,&quot; said Bob Nicholson, a member of the council. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> Our community has voted against the legislation. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> We have done this for what it has not the government and then, for what was decided by the state. </seg>
<seg id="2405"> There are still many questions unanswered. </seg>
<seg id="2406"> Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied out of Oxford, because I am Tory </seg>
<seg id="2407"> Not only university students of today are being attacked for her views </seg>
<seg id="2408"> It was always my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> Both my father and my older brother had visited the university that I once thought to the largest knowledge stamp in the world, for a modern Greek symposium that, the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance - did. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> But within two weeks after my arrival in Worscester College at the end of the eighties -, I had intended to study history - I had packed my suitcase and brought about the first scandal of my life. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> My father broke down in tears. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> My friends were confused. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> In the Evening Standard said that I would have gone, because I had a problem that had students in neighboring rooms. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> The author of A N Wilson said, I would have left the university, because I was forced to drink from damaged cups. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> But the truth was less amusing. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> I ran away. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> Yes, because I suffered from systematic harassment and threats. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Not because of my unusual name, or because I came from a private school. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> We were harassed me for one reason only - a that seemed in this supposed birthplace of enlightenment to so narrow and cruel: My late father now Woodrow Wyatt was a key adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I advocate of the Conservative Party. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> Why do I mention this now? </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Now, recent reports indicate is a new generation of students of the moderate rights under similar prosecution. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> The organised and rising hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now taken on such proportions that a group of them last week called for the same protection, equality of gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College said that they are often isolated because of their political views &quot;active, attacked personally and declared undesirable.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2424"> They are calling for a place in the equality Nominierungskomitee their college to ensure that their views can be expressed freely. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> Their situation has been exacerbated by a recent documentary on political students screened on BBC Two, &quot;Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right,&quot; the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis. </seg>
<seg id="2426"> It has been shown, among other things, a graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student association at the University of Oxford, who drove an and silver suit and silberbesetztem Go flaunted Tock. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> Conservative students at other universities say they are as &quot;scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2428"> The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the conservative student at the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper: &quot;There is a growing tendency to link universities. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> People say we are like the cyber-bulling Don club, without us ever get to have. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="2430"> Samuel Roberts, 21, and history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, believes such a climate &quot;uncomfortable.&quot; The 19-year-old Stephanie, Ill, says the President of the conservative student association of Oxford, they have seen members of a growing opposition to students of the moderate right. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> &quot;This poses a threat to the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of members,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> In my first weeks in Oxford I was such a minority. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> As I was unbelievably timid 18-year-old in September 1986. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> Last year the university voted for Margaret Thatcher, a former student - to give due to cuts in higher education has no official title. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> The atmosphere could have been even Stalinists. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> In the first days of the week, get to know the new students and tutors, I received a foretaste of the future events. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> I made the experience that the the mockery of Tory students only tolerated, but even with joy. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> Political issues such as the miners &quot;strike, privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa found their way into the wood-panelled rooms of the Tutoriums. </seg>
<seg id="2440"> In the first of these events should I French texts from the 18th century translated into English. On what should have been, I was not taken. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> &quot;Miss Wyatt,&quot; said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), &quot;please translate the first paragraph.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2442"> I stumbled. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> Pitt was a small man with a face like a pie dough, and quite unpleasant. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> &quot;Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are you just stupid?&quot; He asked me. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> The kicherten other students. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> Wallten tears in my eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> &quot;I suggest that you take in your spare time a few French hours - that is, if you are not too busy with your social activities,&quot; growled am Pitt. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> I returned with hängendem head in my room. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> That evening I was in college at the dinner alone, I tippte someone typed me slightly on the back. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> It was an English student from the second year named James, who presented himself as a member of the conservative student association. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> &quot;I know who you are,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> Unfortunately, it is, as it is. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> Anyone who is suspected of being Tory, harassed her. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> For me, it is bad enough, but you know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be for you. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> Most Tory first-year purport to be supporters of the Labour Party. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> In a local pub I later tried to distract me. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> I insisted that I was not entirely agree with Mrs Thatcher. </seg>
<seg id="2458"> This trick should prove unsuccessful. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> A first-year professional philosophy, politics and economy, which, ironically, had visited as a conservative force Eton College, said to me: &quot;You&apos;re the daughter of a fascist pig.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2460"> You are dirty. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> Other students shared his opinion. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> I was perverse and dirty. </seg>
<seg id="2463"> &quot;As the Tories sex?,&quot; asked me one. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> The to beat each other, or? </seg>
<seg id="2465"> I felt I had to have felt the same way as homosexuals from the more liberal legislation in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2466"> Would I ever be able to lead a normal life at Oxford University? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> I would like to meet with like-minded after nightfall? </seg>
<seg id="2468"> I should the Labour Party and to suppress my natural inclinations? </seg>
<seg id="2469"> The three years that lay before me, I extended my intellectual eye to a purgatory of condemnation and isolation. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> The only tutor, who announced himself as a Tory, was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, which had its headquarters in my college. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also because he Thatcher in matters of foreign policy advice and had written speeches for them. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> He was rarely there. </seg>

<seg id="2558"> There are people for whom their work is hell, and others are literally in hell. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers who earn their living by recruiting them sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> Every day he has to get down on the floor of the crater, where solidified itself out of the earth, sulphurous gas in contact with the air. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> He has extracted large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilograms, he transported them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders on the slope of the paths of stone. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted porters need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the turtle pace, with the balance and must put their steps carefully so that they do not slip and fall. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> You know that each step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen. </seg>

<seg id="2596"> I am a patriotic husband, you&apos;re my patriotic wife: we are fulfilling our civic duty and create life! </seg>
<seg id="2597"> It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for a mint candies, but nevertheless, or precisely because - they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viral video on YouTube. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> The rates are part of a rapper songs, the local slogans such as &quot;is pushing a&quot; bao &quot; (loaf) in the oven to worry about the low birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2599"> The advertising company BBH, who shot the video, preserves the hope that the advert on the way to raise awareness of the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> Its creative director Douglas Hamilton said that he wanted to use the power of music to get people to their &quot;national duty.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2601"> This is something only for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> It is the biggest problem in this country. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> In Fort plant, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that there is an issue that we had to take care of. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the marketing of perfume or with under the organization of Speed Dating evenings (rapid flirting). </seg>
<seg id="2605"> It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily succeed. </seg>
<seg id="2606"> So we thought: Why not make something as creative as possible, in order to address this problem, for example, how to compose a rap? </seg>
<seg id="2607"> 1.2 children </seg>
<seg id="2608"> Those who do not take this issue lightly, the Government of Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> Every year, they are $1,300 for political action to encourage citizens to have more children. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> A package of government for married couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax advantages. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> But everything has had little success so far. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> Singapore is a wealthy, hi-tech city-state in South East Asia, which is also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> In accordance with its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2614"> The last time, when the rate was about 2 - which is also known as replacement rate - was in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2615"> So why not get the more children? </seg>
<seg id="2616"> Tan Wei Ming, director for marriage and family policy of national civil authority, says that it is in a &quot;better education&quot; and &quot;greater career opportunities.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2617"> &quot;This has allowed people to marry and to have to form a family much more options in terms of life goals and priorities,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> These changes in social conditions have contributed to the higher number of people living alone and the delay of the marriage and birth, is the result of the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a sharp increase in immigration to counter the reduction of the population to resentment among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> In Singapore, there are Web sites, where the barely concealed xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese, who are criticised for low wages and not integrate. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> The rise in immigration is seen as one of the reasons that the ruling party in Singapore last year reached its worst election result since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2622"> Since the elections, there was an attempt to correct the problem with higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> Unexpected consequences </seg>

<seg id="2628"> These apartments have a residential area of 46 square metres and show a great sales success. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> However, there is concern that they can support the lifestyle of living alone, and that they discourage the construction companies to build large homes for families. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of the real estate company El Developers, says that his &quot;shoe boxes&quot; to sell much more quickly than larger apartments. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> They are so popular, and the units are sold out for days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> This means that they are much better for our cash flow. </seg>
<seg id="2633"> It is, however, that the new standards give the developers clearer guidelines, which were previously put obstacles in the way if they wanted to build too many small residential units in a project. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Too much stress </seg>
<seg id="2635"> Singapore is a city-state. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, is the talks with the Singapore, working in the financial district, that they will not have a major impact. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> &quot;The people are stressed, the housing and education are expensive, so it will be delayed by many,&quot; says a young manager. </seg>

<seg id="2681"> Marie Los Porras, a teacher of English with university degree in education and learning, says that the children and young people, must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> &quot;The Internet was created as a vehicle for the search for information, with the release of these pages have changed the rules of the game but,&quot; she says. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> Porras explained that the academics Marc Prensky, holder of a master&apos;s degree in education at Yale University and the author of &quot;digital natives and Immigrants,&quot; these words to explain the phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> The digital natives, they are children and young people who grew up with this technology. </seg>
<seg id="2685"> &quot;We are the digital immigrants that they should teach, where we learn even more,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> He says that it is a complex issue, &quot;because we demand that they have a defined criteria about what should be published or said, in an age where the maturity is not sufficient.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2687"> &quot;They should also be picky when it is most important to them, to be popular to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences,&quot; he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> According to the expert is the most effective way to teach children and young people, which is what privacy, to ask them questions that brings them food for thought. </seg>
<seg id="2689"> &quot;To tell you not to do it, does not work,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Porras then lists several options: There are things that you don&apos;t tell a stranger. Why are you doing it on the Internet? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> Or, if you like if you published a photo of you, as it was released from a friend? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> You know what you publish the other? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> Have you asked for the others advance permission, if you have labelled pictures of celebrations? </seg>
<seg id="2694"> And another question: Is all know what you&apos;re doing in each moment? </seg>
<seg id="2695"> A further point is to give them that they must act online, as they do offline. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> They are the same rules. </seg>
<seg id="2697"> &quot;Someone outside of the Internet is with respect, decency and other principles, and the same should apply to the social networks,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> Monitoring </seg>
<seg id="2699"> Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, says that it is essential that parents read carefully the guidelines of the social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> If they understand all of it, they have solid foundations to talk with their children about the importance of the Eröffnens one user account on the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> &quot;For example, the age, or what should share or publish it,&quot; he says. </seg>
<seg id="2702"> According to to the children of the lesson &quot;thou shalt not talk to strangers.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2703"> The conclusion of the summit of the Unasur without publication of the Lima Declaration </seg>
<seg id="2704"> The 6th summit of the President of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, which was announced before and in theory should be signed by the seven Members who are in power. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> Efe, repeatedly sought access to the document signed at the Sixth Annual meeting of the Heads of State and government of the Unasur. Sources in the Heads of State and Presidents Office initially told that they would pass the exam, but afterwards said that it would be published at a time on the website of the Peruvian government. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> The text they gave that the content of the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, was in brief statements to the press. </seg>
<seg id="2707"> The journalists &quot;access to information on the summit meeting was restricted at any time. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> During the day was in the press room only the image of the President meeting without tone with the message &quot;private meeting, limited audio.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2709"> The few information, among the journalists, were received by the press spokesman for some of the governments who were present at the meeting of the Unasur, but not from the Peruvian press. </seg>

<seg id="2711"> After that, the president of Peru sent the media an e-mail with the &quot;final statement&quot; of the summit, but the statement by Humala was not official document on the conclusion of the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> Last October, was the host of the Summit Zadymka South America - Arab states (ASPA), and on this occasion, despite a call by the press, the so-called Declaration of Lima, which was announced in advance,. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> On the official website of the ASPA can assure him that the document was published last Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> On both international meeting stressed the Peruvian authorities, that the information systems for the journalists, but they were limited to a large extent, access to information. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> The summit ended with the shared commitment of Chile and Peru, to accept a judgment of the Court of Justice in the Hague, which settles a border dispute between the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> Ollanta Humala, the president of Peru and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the ICJ, which starts on Monday in the Hague, in the process, which, the Lima against Santiago, listen to the pleas of both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2717"> &quot;We will judge the differences that we have at the moment, follow this international court of Justice and,&quot; said Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> &quot;Chile was, is and remains a country that complies with international laws, is seeking peaceful solutions to disputes, agreements and to the international courts,&quot; adds Piñera and gave Humala with a handshake before the flags of both countries. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> The confirmation of both presidents that they would abide by the ICJ, came after Colombia for a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, who was a serious mistake, had charges against the agreement of Bogotá, which agreed to abide by the rulings of the International Court of Justice. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> Present at the summit were the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, of Bolivia, Evo Morales, and of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> Paraguay, which has ruled since 2011 after the ousting of its President Fernando Lugo of the Unasur, did not at the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> The host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit shortly after lunchtime in Lima. </seg>
<seg id="2723"> The Head of state read the final document, which said that 16 decisions taken and the guidelines for 31 projects between the South American countries with an investment amount of $17 billion. </seg>
<seg id="2724"> The decisions made, he said that the countries of the Unasur &quot;will take significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, including extending the decisions on residence rights.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2725"> He said that would push ahead with to &quot;cooperation in the fight against insecurity in cities and against organised to improve cross-border crime, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and in the the case of natural disasters to act jointly and effectively.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2726"> With the crisis in Europe, &quot;the economic consolidation (in Latin America) no triumphant trains, but to expand our production capacity and a better future for our peoples,&quot; Humala said. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> &quot;We have decided to give a series of 31 flagship projects, which are intended to improve the spatial relationships in South America and particularly in rural and border areas... And our countries unite and develop new forms of business,&quot; said the Peruvian president in a statement read. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> These projects would be five Peruvian who are on the horizontal axis of his area from the coast to Brazil, and which will deliver two for a better relationship with Ecuador, although he gave no further details. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> Similarly, the final document on the political situation in Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> &quot;We hope that the electoral process in this country for his in the Union of South American Nations,&quot; which it is currently excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> The need for Latin America remains an integrated region for prosperity and peace and good neighbourly relations, was another aspect which was stressed at the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> In this sense, said the President of Colombia Juan Manuel Santos, before the start of his participation in the regional meeting that he was in Mexico on Saturday a meeting with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, expected to deal with the maritime conflict after an of Bogotá into question the judgment of the ICJ. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> &quot;Maybe I will tomorrow (Saturday) meeting with the President Daniel Ortega,&quot; said Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> &quot;We will check all these paths - they are not exclusive, and also the agreement with Nicaragua, talks with Nicaragua is necessary,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> &quot;I hope to be able to tell the President Ortega that we are civilised this matter and will as possible,&quot; Santos added. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they have the intention of the inauguration of the country&apos;s new President, Enrique Peña Nieto to be present. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> As part of the summit also met in the run-up to the defence minister of the block the adoption of the action plan for the year 2013, which seeks to strengthen the dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of the UNASUR, even if the latter is ruled out. </seg>
<seg id="2739"> Peru has the presidency at the time of the regional bloc. </seg>
<seg id="2740"> &quot;South America must learn to the integration of the citizens,&quot; says Rafael Correa </seg>
<seg id="2741"> The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that a goal is the creation of a common citizenship, and &quot;South America can learn something from Europe.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2742"> Correa, who is the 6th summit of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, told state television in Peru, that the Europeans &quot;killed in the Second World War and other conflicts&quot; and &quot;are now virtually a fatherland.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2743"> In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, the members countries of the Unasur. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> &quot;We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community; but there is still a reactionary sectors who want a return to the past,&quot; he warned. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> The President of Ecuador also advocated the reform of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the target to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and take into account those who have signed the San José Agreement on human rights. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Those who teach, never commit to something, and in exchange we sign the South Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2747"> &quot;It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, based in Washington and financed by the United States,&quot; he said in to the political asylum, Ecuador, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, was granted. </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Correa assured that he does not regret that decision, because he did not betray his principles, but his &quot;deep democratic values and views on human rights.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2749"> He added that it &quot;was at the time, that Assange extradited to a third country and would not be complied with procedures.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2750"> He also criticised the Swedish justice system, which requires him to an interrogation because of an alleged sexual offence, while the Swedish law &quot;allowed through a video conference on its territory the Embassy of Ecuador in London could have been carried out.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2751"> Correa said that there was a risk that would affect the health and mental state of Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> &quot;He is in our message that I have not spoken with him, the ambassador informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but no serious,&quot; said the Head of Ecuador. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> There is a danger, though, that he would be physical and psychological damage, because he was caught in a tight space and could not carry out physical exercises outdoors. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> &quot;That would affect the health of all people,&quot; he added. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> Correa stated that the solution to the asylum, Assange was granted since the month of June in the Ecuador Embassy in London, is the granting of a free letter, so he could travel to Ecuador, and that it is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities Europe&apos;s lies. He stressed that there had been talks with London to find a solution to the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> We do not act with human rights, that we do not apply in this case, however, there were ongoing talks. </seg>
<seg id="2757"> &quot;The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe, because Assange&apos;s lawyer, Sanguineti Tsar Garzón, a series of procedures at various European forums,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> And &quot;when Britain granted morning this, in my opinion, this is done.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2759"> And if Mr Assange to Sweden interrogated on the Embassy of Ecuador in London or via Skype, as allowed under Swedish law and in other cases, be resolved the problem. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> Correa took the opportunity to prove himself as a defender of the freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate &quot;the mediocrity, the bad faith and the lie that infringe the freedom of expression.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2761"> &quot;The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverted politician, but bad journalists who seek to profit and blackmail,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2762"> In this sense, he congratulated himself that Ecuador more dominated by such journalists &quot;and not by bankers or hegemonic and spießbürgerlichen countries,&quot; and I think he took a re-election &quot;will deepen the revolution to continue the way in the right direction.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2763"> Correa also supported the decision to uphold the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organism &quot;must stand firm and no opportunism and no grieving as a legal coup d,&quot; because it &quot;was destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2764"> The President of Ecuador is also the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the verdict of the International Court of Justice in the Hague, which places the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, Nicaragua to negotiate with the seerechtlichen borders between the two countries, is &quot;absolutely right.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2765"> Currently, this judgment is not being implemented. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> It is a problem between the South and Central American state. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path. </seg>
<seg id="2768"> They must be fully addressed, so that they can overcome and look forward. </seg>
<seg id="2769"> Similarly, he said to a successful conclusion of the dispute over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same court that &quot;it is right to go to international bodies for Latin America, if both countries commit themselves to accept the verdict, even if it is very hard.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2770"> With regard to the possibility that he presents himself as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador in order to reach his third consecutive mandate, he admitted that he &quot;sees this opportunity with optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2771"> Correa assured that if he would lose the elections in February 2013 that he would retire from political life. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> Has never interested me personally, but in doing so unjust circumstances such as these socio-economic poverty in Ecuador can only be corrected by the political power. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> &quot;My political movement, I had the belief that it was, which guaranteed the likely victory, so I must assume this responsibility,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> If I were to win, it would be my last term as President, I retreat from public life. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> This also applies when we lose. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> &quot;It is decided,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> Correa also took on the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> I just finished with the vice president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. He told me that he had been planned for a routine treatment there, and that would be expected that he could travel to Cuba again after the election campaign. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> &quot;It in no way means a return to the state of health of President Chavez,&quot; he commented. </seg>
<seg id="2780"> The Ecuadorian leader today in Lima on the 6th Summit of the Heads of State or Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with the call for greater regional integration, in order for sustainable progress, equality and security. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> The cause of a death due to AIDS is now too late detection </seg>
<seg id="2782"> Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the outcome of the inquiry: HIV positive. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> &quot;It was as if a bomb hit,&quot; he says about the moment when he received the diagnosis, the doctor without visible success &quot;tried to weaken.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2784"> He hid it from his family. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> He decided to devote himself to his disease and started to inform themselves about, and this with such commitment, that he just celebrated his 43th birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several battles in 1994. </seg>
<seg id="2787"> Fabrizio lives with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in 22 years, at the beginning of the 90 s was hard to see as many doubts, there were few treatment options and more Stigmata. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> At that time, even the director of a clinic of the IMSS, to say goodbye, &quot;because it led to a dead end.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2789"> AIDS was synonymous with death. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> However, there are still many people in the clinic, who know none of their disease and the virus already has caused damage and has exhausted her immune system, and the victims of opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> 31 years after the release of AIDS in the world, the first reported cases, &quot;the great success today that the survival of a patient who undergoes treatment in time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same,&quot; said the head of the HIV unit of the HCG diet, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, although he said that this information had been based in April this year from a respected scientific publication. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> The an expert in infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, the scientists have that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that was the years of survival and quality of life by the degree of impairment of the immune system of people at the start of treatment, and that would give greater opportunities that are not addicts: up to 30 years in a census of 200 CD4 and 50 years for on a count of 500 CD4. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Simply put, the above that, at the age of 25 years who gets diagnosed HIV positive, in that sense &quot;can easily be 75 years old, as long as he is under control,&quot; he said the expert. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> In order to evaluate this progress right must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today, an average of 76 years. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> Even if the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS, from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (annual report of the ONUSIDA) affecs), it is nevertheless true that have died since the advent of AIDS in 60 percent of patients covered in the national database. </seg>
<seg id="2797"> In Jalisco in the year 2011 255 people died, and until the month of May this year, 187 deaths; however, to be reassured that there are is universal access to anti-retroviral drugs since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> - Why are still dying people? </seg>
<seg id="2799"> - In my opinion, is not the problem of access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2801"> At least in the last 12 years we have had no problems with the supply of drugs. The problem is that the people in far advanced state, because they do not know their infectious condition, i.e. in very late stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> He makes a striking statement: &quot;Nine out of ten patients come to us, if you already have an infection. In order to be able to influence the global mortality, earlier diagnosis is necessary, and all the people, where necessary, must be offered screening tests on a massive scale.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="2803"> This proposal, the experts and officials of the Consejo de plans del Sida en Jalisco (Coe Ida) (state committee for AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and the patient as Fabrizio, who his test at a private laboratory had called, and it was only because a friend had made by him, despite his young age already in the AIDS era was, and even the Kaposi&apos;s Sarcoma (a cancerous tumor), which is one of the usual complications. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> Everything is different, if you know that you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> Some think that they will die, and we do not want to hear. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> &quot;If I have to die, then burst three times,&quot; they say in my case. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> The change was to the improvement, I ernähre me well, I take the medication. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> Today his parents know only that he had cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> I live a normal life, like everyone else. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> &quot;I am, do a lot, have an active sex lives, but responsible, I respect to my health and that of the other person,&quot; Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to encourage those who have today with his testimony in the context of the global AIDS Day fear. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> They should make the test if they belong to the risk group. The sooner they know whether they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live like all people. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> Condoms behind the counter </seg>
<seg id="2814"> Between health programmes and the ordinary citizens there are major holes, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has taken up the cause of HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> And the most important thing is prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> In the specific places &quot;was actually increased the distribution of condoms; previously they were made separately, now they give us packages with one hundred pieces, which is good, but there are still people who do not have access to an a condom,&quot; he said. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> The risk for new infections among young people. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> &quot;Why do you need?&quot; Is a widespread derision question of social workers, guidance staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and health system, which does not want to expose young people, the correspondent said. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> He proposed to move this inefficient distribution; the condoms are not only behind the counter, but in output devices in public toilets of facilities that are frequented by young people. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> It should not be promoted promiscuity. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> It should not be paid for the beer and Motel, as the governor Emilio Gonzalez replied to the question of whether condoms would be distributed under his administration. </seg>
<seg id="2822"> &quot;Sexuality does not; it is best to bring the closer to those who already have a sexual activity,&quot; he brought it to the point. </seg>
<seg id="2823"> Key data from Jalisco </seg>
<seg id="2824"> There are 13,435 total (12,158 AIDS cases and 1,317 HIV). </seg>
<seg id="2825"> The state is seen nationally in 4th place new and cumulative AIDS cases, and in 13th place in relation to HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> 92% of cases of infection through sexual intercourse, 6% of the blood and 2% perinatal. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, because there are non-subcribers case for every 4 or 5 people who do not know. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> After the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a ruling by the United States, which does not recognise the restructuring of the liabilities of the group, which has been on a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, will set a damaging precedent for each national companies with branches in the neighbouring country, has the payment problems. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> So you could say that the procedure for the survival of the companies that allow the Mexican laws, in the land of the stars and stripes in contravention of international agreements. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> In practice, the recognition of the judgment handed down on 15 June by the judges Harlin Hale court in Bancarrotas for the northern district in Texas to Mexican companies are subject to the confiscation of their property on the other side of the river Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2831"> However, the decision opens the door largest glass manufacturer in Mexico, to call for three inconsistencies the Supreme Court of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> While the judge refers the matter to ensure that the bankruptcy law of the United States, says the creditors must be subject to the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit based in New Orleans, first of all, that the main proceedings for the trade is dealt with in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2833"> The first point would mean that international cooperation is not in procedures in the event of the insolvency of companies with trans-national profile. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> In fact, was created to this end, the model law of the United Nations for the unification of international trade law, with the American law Institute as a peacemaker. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> Secondly, the judgment that without the votes of the societies after recognizing the liabilities of the estate, who had the branches of in-vitro with its parent company, would not have achieved the required majority for in of the restructuring of the debt. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> However, this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> In fact, is not the first case in which this scheme has been. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among companies in the group from the Instituto Federal de when Mercanti (Federal Institute for commercial bankruptcies) were confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> It is also true that after the withdrawal of the voices of the creditors branches in vitro, the creditors, the in the courts of the United States against vitro, the vulture funds such as Aurel Georgios Capital, Aurel MINISTERIOS Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, had no majority. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> The vote was 45 percent against 37 percent. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal. </seg>
<seg id="2842"> On the other hand, there are to blame for its difficult position from 2008 as part of the great economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> For this reason, the Gonzalez Sada family before the same court of appeal against an order for the vote in plenary, in that, all the judges, because only three of them were. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> It is that, the Cerciorare protest calling for the review of the procedure by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> This is most serious in this case that the court a document, the Mexican government under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the court) has been sent, which in vitro procedure within the framework of the law on trading bankruptcies, and what is pointed out that it had kept strictly to the agreement signed by by both countries in order to respond to the Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> It also noted that the country is subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e., the established rules for the cross-border insolvency cases of guarantee equality between debtors and creditors. </seg>

<seg id="2878"> There were many play successive years, including the five championships in a row from 1971 to 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> And then I said goodbye with a championship in 1981, the year of debuts by Jerome Mincy BSN. </seg>

<seg id="2884"> Then recommended to the free throw Raymond Gausse specialists and was one of our best shooter. </seg>

<seg id="2907"> What can you do? </seg>
<seg id="2908"> There are things that I would have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> The guys in Ponce, for example, only in their area and meet in the national playoffs teams from other corners of the island. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> Today, many children unnecessary trips and games. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> At least I can see the result of the prescribed training and courses for coaches, officials and referees. </seg>

<seg id="2913"> What are you doing today? </seg>
<seg id="2914"> I would like to listen to music, watch videos of music my time in YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren and now and then I go to a basketball game. </seg>
